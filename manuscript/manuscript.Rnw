\section{Abstract}

The placenta is arguably the most anatomically variable organ in
mammals. Understanding gene expression patterns among placentas from
multiple species can illuminate the molecular basis of placenta
function as well as potentially enrich our knowledge of the biology of
obstetrical syndromes. We profiled the term placenta by using Illumina
RNA-Seq technology to sequence the transcriptomes of
\Sexpr{star.logs[,length(unique(species))]} species of therian (i.e.
marsupials and âplacentalâ) mammals. We identified significant shifts
in gene expression along specific evolutionary lineages using a model
of character evolution. Genes that showed significant elevation in
expression along the human lineage ($\mathrm{FDR}\le 0.01$) were
enriched in GO categories such as angiogenesis, tube morphogenesis,
cell migration, and regulation of inflammatory response. Three of
these genes (KISS1, ADAM12, GPC3) showed exceptionally high expression
in humans; these genes are implicated in preeclampsia and may indicate
that the risk of preeclampsia recently emerged on the human lineage.

\section{Introduction}

The main role of the placenta in viviparous mammals is the transfer of
nutrients, oxygen, and waste between mother and offspring. Although
these functions are conserved among mammals, the placenta is perhaps
the most variable organ in terms of structure and form
\cite{Mossman.1937:comparativemorphogenesisofthe}. Species differ in
the shape of attachment (i.e., discoid, diffuse, cotyledonary,
zonary), degree of invasiveness of fetal tissues into maternal tissues
(i.e. epitheliochorial, endotheliochorial, hemochorial), and degree of
interdigitation of maternal-fetal tissue (i.e., villous, folded,
trabecular, lamellar, labrynthine)
\cite{Mossman.1987:vertebratefetalmembranes}. In addition, therian
mammals differ drastically in the number and size of their offspring,
as well as the length of gestation, traits often associated with
specific aspects of placental morphology
\cite{Capellini.ea2011:Placentationandmaternalinvestment}.

The placenta arose at some point before the origin of therian mammals,
a group that includes both marsupials and eutherian or âplacentalâ
mammals. The term âplacental mammalsâ is misleading, as marsupials
also possess a placenta, although its direct apposition to maternal
tissues lasts for a proportionally shorter time during gestation
\cite{Renfree2010:ReviewMarsupialsplacentalmammals}. Marsupials also differ from eutherian mammals in
that most possess only a choriovitelline placenta, produced from the
fusion of the chorion and yolk sac, during most of gestation. Although
some eutherian mammals may possess a choriovitelline placenta at some
point in development, the major site of nutrient exchange in
placentals occurs via the chorioallantoic placenta, produced from the
fusion of the chorion and allantois \cite{Mossman.1987:vertebratefetalmembranes}. It is unclear
whether the first placenta was more like that of marsupials or
eutherians; however, using phylogenetic methods, the ancestral
eutherian was reconstructed as possessing a relatively invasive
hemochorial placenta, in which the maternal and fetal blood supply is
separated by one tissue layer, as in humans and mouse
\cite{Elliot.ea2009:Phylogeneticevidenceforearly,Wildman.ea2006:Evolutionofmammalianplacenta}.

Although the morphology of the mammalian placenta has been well
characterized in a number of species \cite{Mossman.1987:vertebratefetalmembranes}, the diversity of
the molecular environment is only beginning to be understood from a
genetic perspective \cite{Carter2012:Evolutionofplacentalfunction}. Studies of certain model species
(i.e., humans, mice, cattle) have revealed a stunning divergence in
the genetics of the placenta, especially in later stages of pregnancy
\cite{Carter2012:Evolutionofplacentalfunction,Hou.ea2012:Elephanttranscriptomeprovidesinsights,Knox.ea2008:Genomicevolutionofplacenta,Su.ea2002:Large-scaleanalysisofhuman}.
For example, each lineage has evolved expansive
placenta-specific gene families with expression patterns that can vary
in space and time \cite{Green.ea2000:Pregnancy-associatedbovineandovine,Simmons.ea2008:Spatialandtemporalexpression}. These
include independent expansions of the prolactins in mouse and cow,
pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) in humans and mouse,
pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) in cow, and the expansion of
the growth hormone and chorionic gonadotropin beta genes in hominoid
primates \cite{Haig2008:Placentalgrowthhormone-relatedproteins,Rawn.ea2008:evolutionregulationandfunction}. Expression patterns of
specific genes also can vary widely between species. For example, the
expression of orthologous genes in the placenta have been found to
vary substantially between humans and mice \cite{Su.ea2002:Large-scaleanalysisofhuman}, and the
recruitment of SIGLEC6 to placental expression in humans differs from
both chimpanzees and mice \cite{Linden.ea2007:Human-specificexpressionofSiglec-6}.

One explanation for the divergent paths of the placental interface is
the distinct evolutionary interplay between maternal and fetal
strategies during pregnancy \cite{Haig1993:Geneticconflictsinhuman}. The maternal strategy is to
requisition an adequate degree of nutrients to the fetus without
risking the health of the mother, while the fetal strategy via
paternal genes is to extract as many resources from the mother as
possible. Therefore, an interplay between these extremes can set up an
intricate âarms raceâ, involving the imprinting of parental alleles,
production of new genes, and enlistment of existing genes to
expression at the maternal-fetal interface \cite{Haig1993:Geneticconflictsinhuman}.

One symptom
of this maternal-fetal conflict is its potential affect on human
health \cite{Hollegaard.ea2013:Parent-offspringconflictandpersistence}. 
In addition to having an invasive
hemochorial placenta, humans possess a deeply invasive trophoblast
layer that can penetrate the myometrium of the uterus 
\cite{Carter.ea2011:Evolutionofinvasiveplacentation}.
 Defects in placental growth are known to be
associated with the devastating condition of preeclampsia, which can
cause hypertension, proteinuria, and has the potential to lead to
death of the mother and/or infant \DLA{(citation)}. Although cases have been
documented in chimpanzees and gorillas \DLA{(citation)}, preeclampsia has a
far higher incidence in human pregnancies with as much as 4\% of
pregnancies being affected in the United States \DLA{(citation)}.
Chimpanzees and gorillas also have deeply invasive trophoblasts,
although the progression of invasion in great apes may be slower than
humans \cite{Carter.ea2011:Evolutionofinvasiveplacentation}; however, large-scale expression
studies of great ape placentas have not been conducted. The increasing
affordability of next-generation sequencing technology has enabled the
large-scale study of specific tissues from a wide array of species to
address broader phylogenetic questions in the evolution of gene
expression \cite{Brawand.ea2011:evolutionofgeneexpression}. Here we use Illumina RNA-Seq
technology to sequence and quantify the mRNA environment of six
mammalian placentas at term, including that of the human, bonobo (the
sister species to the chimpanzee), dog, cow, African elephant, and
opossum, representing marsupials as well as three major branches of
eutherian mammals (Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria).
These placentas also represent a wide array of placental morphologies
as well as traits such as number and size of offspring and length of
gestation \DLA{(Table 1)}. We use this data, along with existing RNA-Seq
data from mouse \cite{Wang.ea2011:surveyfornovelimprinted}, to address the major differences
between expression in marsupial and eutherian mammals at term,
identify the evolution of expression in important placental genes such
as hormones and galectins, identify novel lineage-specific expression
patterns, and quantify human specific differences in gene expression
that may be related to obstetrical disorders such as preeclampsia.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Collection of Placental Tissue and RNA Extraction}

Fetal tissue was collected from the placenta of six mammalian species
(\textit{Homo sapiens} [human], \textit{Pan paniscus} [bonobo], \textit{Canis familiaris}
[domestic dog], \textit{Bos taurus} [domestic cow], \textit{Loxodonta africana} [African
savanna elephant], \textit{Monodelphis domestica} [gray short-tailed
opossum], \textit{Nannospalax gallili} [?], \textit{Spalax carmelli} [?]).
Information on specimen ID, place and time of collection,
and collector is shown for each sample in \DLA{Supplemental Table 1}. In the
case of \textit{Pan}, \textit{Bos}, and \textit{Loxodonta}, the placenta was collected at term
upon expulsion from the mother following delivery. Placental tissue
from \textit{Homo sapiens} was collected upon delivery via a caesarian section.
Near-term placental tissue from \textit{Canis familiaris} was collected upon
the death of the mother from a car accident. Placental tissue from
\textit{Monodelphis domestica} was sampled at fetal stage 32, roughly one day
prior to birth. Only the fetal portion of the placenta was sampled at
the maternal-fetal interface (i.e. villous portion for \textit{Homo}, \textit{Pan},
\textit{Canis}, and \textit{Loxodonta}; cotyledon for \textit{Bos}; diffuse placenta for
\textit{Monodelphis}). All tissues were collected and stored in RNAlater (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) until RNA isolation could be performed.
Tissues were homogenized in Trizol, and total RNA was isolated
following the manufacturerâs instructions. RNA was further purified
using RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), in conjunction with the
RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the
manufacturerâs protocol to remove any contaminating DNA from the
sample. Total RNA was then evaluated on a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo
Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Santa
Clara, CA) to confirm concentration and quality of the isolation. RNA
quality was assessed using A260/A280 and A260/A230 absorbance values.

\subsection{Sequencing}

\DLA{Fix how the sequencing was done}

All RNA-Seq mRNA isolation, library construction, and Illumina
sequencing was performed by the Applied Genomics Technology Center
(AGTC) at Wayne State University School of Medicine using 2.5-5 Âµg of
total RNA and standard Illumina protocol. Paired-end sequencing was
performed using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II with an insert size of
230 base pairs (bp). \textit{Bos}, \textit{Loxodonta}, and
\textit{Monodelphis} were sequenced with read lengths of 75 bp;
\textit{Canis}, \textit{Homo}, and \textit{Pan} were sequenced with
read lengths of 150 bp.

For comparison, additional sequences of placenta in \textit{Mus
  musculus} \cite{Wang.ea2011:surveyfornovelimprinted} and
\textit{Homo sapiens}
\cite{Hughes.ea2015:Evaluatingintra-andinter-individual} were obtained
from the \ac{SRA}.

\subsection{Transcriptome Assembly, Alignment, and Quantification}

The quality of reads was evaluated using FASTQC v0.11.2
(\url{http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/}).
Transcriptomes without a suitable reference genome (Reference of ---
in \fref{tab:ref_genome_aligned_species}) were assembled into a
reference using Trinity v2014-07-17
\cite{Haas.ea2013:Denovotranscriptsequence} and annotated using
Diamond \cite{Buchfink.ea2015:Fastandsensitiveprotein} against either
the \textit{Homo sapiens} or \textit{Mus musculus} transcriptome
(\fref{tab:ref_genome_aligned_species}).
% 
All transcriptomes were then aligned to the appropriate reference
genome using STAR v2.4.2a
\cite{Dobin.ea2013:STARultrafastuniversalRNA-seq} and expression
values in \ac{FPKM}
\cite{Trapnell.ea2010:Transcriptassemblyandquantification} were
quantified using Cufflinks v2.2.1
\cite{Trapnell.ea2009:TopHatdiscoveringsplicejunctions}.
%
The genome of the closely-related \textit{Pan troglodytes} was used as
a reference for \textit{Pan paniscus}. The separation between the two
recognized Pan species is generally perceived to be $\approx 1$ Mya
\cite{PrÃ¼fer.ea2012:bonobogenomecomparedwith}.

\subsection{Exploration of Individual Transcriptome Data}

To determine enrichment levels of functional categories of genes in
highly-expressed transcripts in each transcriptome, we performed
functional annotation cluster analyses per transcriptome using DAVID
\cite{Huang.ea2009:Systematicandintegrativeanalysis,Sherman.ea2007:DAVIDKnowledgebasegene-centereddatabase}.
DAVID ranks functional annotation clusters according to enrichment
score (ES); functional annotation clusters are considered
significantly enriched if ES>1.3, as this corresponds to p<0.05
\cite{Huang.ea2009:Systematicandintegrativeanalysis}. We executed
analyses with two gene lists per transcriptome: 1) annotated genes
with expression levels of the top 5\% of the frequency distribution of
\ac{FPKM} and 2) the top 100 genes with the highest \ac{FPKM}. Due to the
paucity of annotated gene ontology terms for some species, gene lists
were compared using gene ontology terms derived from the human genome.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis of Gene Expression}

All 1:1 orthologues present among human, bonobo, mouse, dog, cow,
elephant, and opossum were determined using Ensembl v.64 gene trees
via the Biomart online data management
tool\cite{Kasprzyk2011:BioMartdrivingparadigmchange}. A total of 6882
1:1 orthologous genes were expressed in at least one species. For
further analysis, we eliminated all genes that did not have at least
one species with an $\mathrm{FPKM}\ge10$. A list of these 4259 1:1 orthologous
genes was retained for future analyses of gene expression evolution
described below.

We used the software OUCH (OrnsteinâUhlenbeck for Comparative
Hypotheses) in the R statistical environment to investigate
significant shifts in gene expression levels over
time\cite{Butler.2004:phlogeneticcomparativeanalysis}. OUCH institutes
an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of evolution, which allows for
different optima for quantitative trait values along user-specified
branches of a phylogenetic tree. The OU model explicitly accounts for
change in quantitative trait values by introducing two parameters into
the model of stochastic Brownian motion of change in trait value along
a phylogenetic tree through time. These parameters include, $\theta$,
or an optimum trait value, and $\alpha$, or the strength of selection
(interpreted as âpullâ toward the optimum). In addition, the OU model
can also integrate evolutionary change by assuming that each
user-specified set of braches has its own separate OU parameters
\cite{Butler.2004:phlogeneticcomparativeanalysis}.

Various OU branch models were tested against a model in which no
variation in optima among branches was allowed. The following branches
were specified in separate models to have a different optimum than all
other branches: human, bonobo, mouse, dog, cow, elephant, opossum,
human+bonobo, Euarchontoglires, and Boreoeutheria. Likelihood values
were computed for each branch model and compared to an OU model with
one optimum using likelihood ratio tests with df=1. We filtered out
genes with universally low expression levels, and included only genes
in which expression in at least one species had an
$\mathrm{FPKM}\ge10$ as described above. We corrected for multiple
testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) and calculated adjusted
$p$ values (q-values) using the Benjamini-Hochberg
correction\cite{Benjamini1995:bh_procedure}. We used the
time-calibrated phylogenetic tree of
\cite{Meredith.ea2011:ImpactsofCretaceousTerrestrial} with all species
not used in this analyses pruned.

To determine enrichment of functional categories in lists of genes
that display a significant shift in expression on a specific branch,
we performed functional annotation cluster analyses on each branch
using DAVID
\cite{Huang.ea2009:Systematicandintegrativeanalysis,Sherman.ea2007:DAVIDKnowledgebasegene-centereddatabase}.
DAVID ranks functional annotation clusters according to enrichment
score (ES); functional annotation clusters are considered
significantly enriched if $\mathrm{ES}\ge1.3$, as this corresponds to
$p\le0.05$ \cite{Huang.ea2009:Systematicandintegrativeanalysis}. As
above, due to the paucity of annotated gene ontology terms for some
species, gene lists were compared using gene ontology terms derived
from the human genome.

\subsection{Correlation of Tissue Specific Index with Lineage Specific Genes}

To evaluate the extent of tissue specificity of each gene, we
calculated the tissue specificity index based on human microarray data
from (Su et al., 2004) available via BioGPS. The tissue specificity
index (TSI) measures the extent to which a specific gene has
predominant expression in only one tissue (Yanai et al., 2005). A TSI
of 1.0 would signify that a gene was solely expressed in only one
tissue, while a TSI of 0.0 would signify that a gene had equal
expression in all tissues evaluated. We used the formula available in
Yanai et al. (2005) to calculate the TSI, and identified the top four
tissues which expressed each probe set from (Su et al., 2004).

\subsection{Validation of Primate Expression using Spider Monkey Placenta Transcriptome}

To verify expression levels in human and bonobo, we also generated
RNA-Seq data for the placenta transcriptome of the black-headed spider
monkey (\textit{Ateles fusciceps}) using similar protocols discussed above.
Ateles is outside the clade, which includes hominids and can be used
to polarize expression values of highly expressed genes in Homo and
Pan. We sampled placental tissue from an Ateles placenta expelled from
the mother shortly after birth (see Supplemental Table X). We used
similar procedures discussed above to extract and sequence this
sample. [DEREKâIâm unsure how to proceed on describing this so as to
not step on Natalieâs toes]

The percentage of bases that mapped to Ensembl annotated mRNA ranged
from ~35\% in elephant to ~85\% in human, with percentages of bases
mapping to annotated protein-coding segments of genes ranging from
~34\% (elephant) to ~54\% (human), untranslated regions (UTRs) ranging
from ~0.6\% (elephant) to ~31\% (human), and known introns ranging
from ~5.5\% (dog) to 11\% (bonobo). Median percent genomic coverage
ranged from ~43\% in elephant to 80\% in bonobo. The number of
annotated transcripts to which reads mapped in each respective genomes
ranged from 4119 (bonobo) to 6506 (human) for transcripts with \ac{FPKM}>10
and 11689 (dog) to 30733 (human) for transcripts with \ac{FPKM}>1. The
greater degree of mapping to annotated protein-coding sequences in
humans corresponds to the greater number of Ensembl annotated
sequences in the human genome compared to the other five reference
genomes (Flicek, 2012).

The top 50 expressed genes in each genome analyzed are shown in

insulin-like growth factor related genes are shown with \ac{FPKM} values
side to side for all transcriptomes including the reanalysis of mouse
from \cite{Wang.ea2011:surveyfornovelimprinted} in \DLA{Table 8}.
Below we describe each transcriptome separately, specifically

The top 50 expressed genes as measured by \ac{FPKM} in the term

the highest \ac{FPKM} value
%
(\Sexpr{gene.expression(species.name="homo sapiens",gene="CSH1")}) %
%
in humans is \textit{CSH1}, followed by \textit{CSH2}, and \textit{CSHL1}, all
three of which are members of a distinct expansion of the growth
hormone gene family within hominoids (\fref{fig:galectins_evolution_tree}). Another member of the growth
hormone gene family, \ac{GH2} (\ac{FPKM}=%

is also expressed to a high degree in the human placenta
(\fref{tab:top50_human_placenta}).
% 
Eleven pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein genes are highly-expressed

which generates the alpha subnit of multiple human chorionic
gonadotropin hormones (\fref{tab:top50_human_placenta}). The genes

The top 50 expressed genes as measured by \ac{FPKM} in the term
placenta of the bonobo are shown in \fref{tab:top50_bonobo_placenta}
with a list of all genes in Supplemental
\fref{tab:all_pan_paniscus_placenta}. Expression in the bonobo
placenta differs somewhat from that of the human, as evidenced by the
makeup of the top 50 genes (\fref{tab:top50_bonobo_placenta}). The highest expression
(\ac{FPKM}=%
\Sexpr{gene.expression("pan paniscus","PRG2")}%
%
) in bonobo is \textit{PRG2}, which is involved in insulin
growth factor signaling and angiogenesis during pregnancy \cite{Weyer.ea2011:Placentalregulationofpeptide}. \textit{PRG2} is also expressed at relatively high levels in the
human placenta (\ac{FPKM}=\Sexpr{gene.expression("homo sapiens","PRG2")}; Supplemental \fref{tab:all_homo_sapiens_placenta}), although at
comparatively much lower levels than the bonobo. A bonobo gene closely
related to the chorionic somatomammotropins (Q95MK7\_PANTR) is also
expressed at high levels (\ac{FPKM}=1232.56; \fref{tab:top50_bonobo_placenta}). Two other Pan genes
included within this family (ENSPTRG00000030805 which shows similarity
to GH2 and ENSPTRG00000034560) show expression levels of \ac{FPKM}>89. Six
pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein genes were expressed in the
bonobo placenta with \ac{FPKM} ranging from 20.885-167.961 (Supplemental
Table X). Placental expression of the genes involved in estrogen and
progesterone production (CYP19A1, HSD3B1 respectively) show lower
expression in the bonobo as compared to humans (CYP19A1 \ac{FPKM}= 48.6877;
HSD3B1 \ac{FPKM}= 54.5301; Table 8). In addition, CGA is expressed in the
bonobo placenta (\ac{FPKM}=202.629), but at much lower levels than humans
as well (Table 8). Two Ensembl-annotated beta subunits of the
chorionic gonadotropin genes are expressed in bonobo, one related to
CGB and another related to CGB7; both are not highly expressed (Table
8). Among the other top 50 expressed genes, there is high expression
of ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL18, RPL23), keratins (e.g., KRT7,
KRT19), heat-shock proteins (e.g., HSPA5, HSPA1A), serpins (SERPINE1,
SERPINE2), insulin growth factor 2 (IGF2) and the hormone
adrenomedullin (ADM).

The top 50 expressed genes as measured by \ac{FPKM} in the term placenta of
the dog are shown in Table 4 with a list of all genes in Supplemental
Table X. The gene with the highest expression (\ac{FPKM}=48399.9) in the
dog placenta is the hormone relaxin (RLN1). Other highly expressed
genes among the top 50 (Table 4) include genes involved in the
cytoskeleton (TMSB10, TMSB4X), anticoagulation (TFPI2, PLA2G7), innate
immunity (LCN2, GM2A), lipid metabolism (APOE), inhibition of matrix
metalloproteinases (TIMP2, TIMP3), and growth (PGF, EGFR, HTRA1). The
gene LGALS1, which shows evidence of immunosupression during pregnancy
(Than et al., 2008), shows high expression in dog (\ac{FPKM}= 1405.02). In
addition, the gene SSLP1, a gene expressed in the placentas of cow and
sheep but not present in primates (Ushizawa et al., 2009), is also
expressed at high levels (\ac{FPKM}= 1853.98). There is no placental
expression of the estrogen synthase gene (CYP19A1) in dogs, however
expression of HSD3B1 is relatively high (\ac{FPKM}=157.622).

\end{table}

The top 50 expressed genes as measured by \ac{FPKM} in the term placenta of
the dog are shown in Table 5 with a list of all genes in Supplemental
Table X. The gene with the highest expression (\ac{FPKM}=12488.8) was the
miRNA gene bta-mir-2887-1. This gene occurs in several copies in the
cow genome, and it was unclear as to how many or to which of 12
bta-mir-2887 genes this mapped (Supplemental Table X). A previous
study indicated that this miRNA gene was expressed in the bovine ovary
(Hossain et al., 2009). Several members of the ruminant-specific
pregnancy-associated glycoprotein family show especially high
expression in the cow placenta (Table 4, Supplemental Table X)
including PAG2 (\ac{FPKM}=7255.34), PAG10 (2076.42), BT.83780 (1793.72),
PAG11 (962.19), PAG12 (469.751), BT.88769 (408.584), PAG1 (301.61),
PAG4 (186.496), PAG6 (157.348), PAG8 (153.225), and PAG16 (103.573).
In addition, 14 other PAGs were expressed with \ac{FPKM}<40 (Supplemental
Table X). Other genes with high expression include genes involved with
regulation of growth (IGF2, PHLDA2), imprinted genes (GNAS, DLK1,
PHLDA2), and CSH1, a gene that is a member of a ruminant specific
expansion of placental prolactins and not directly related to the gene
of the same name in hominids. Other ruminant-specific placental
prolactins also show high expression in the cow placenta including
PRP1 (632.766), PRP5 (396.832), PRP6 (345.296), PRP2 (195.771), in
addition to 7 other placental prolactins with expression of \ac{FPKM}<51
(Table 5; Supplemental Table X). SSLP1 (also called SOLD1), a gene
expressed in the cotyledonary villi of the ruminiant placenta and
involved in cell proliferation (Ushizawa et al., 2009, 2010), also
shows evidence of high expression (\ac{FPKM}=1001.45). There is some
placental expression of the estrogen synthase gene (CYP19A1) in cows
(75.1346), and comparatively greater expression of HSD3B1 (\ac{FPKM}=
157.622).

\label{tab:top50_elphant_placenta}
\end{table}


The top 50 expressed genes as measured by \ac{FPKM} in the term placenta of
the elephant are shown in Table 6 with a list of all genes in
Supplemental Table X. The gene with the highest expression
(\ac{FPKM}=33439.5) was the natriuretic peptide precursor B (NPPB). The
gene with the second highest expression (\ac{FPKM}=20233) was the microRNA
miR-675, which is imbedded in the first exon of the maternally
imprinted long non-coding RNA gene H19 (Keniry et al., 2012), a gene
also highly expressed in the elephant placenta (\ac{FPKM}=7164.3). Five
uncharacterized genes are expressed to a high degree in the elephant
placenta (Table 6), three of which are a member of an
elephant-specific expansion of 11 genes closely related to the
thymus-specific serine protease gene PRSS16. The other 8 PRSS16-like
genes are also expressed to a lesser degree (FPKM<284.014). Two other
novel genes with high expression are related to the gene SSLP1 (Table
6), which is also expressed in the cow and dog placentas (Tables 4 and
5). Placental expression of the hormones relaxin (RLN1) and prolactin
(PRL) are exceptionally high in the elephant when compared to other
mammals (Tables 6 and 8). There is little to no placental expression
of the estrogen synthase gene, CYP19A1, (FPKM<1) and the enzyme that
produces progesterone HSD3B1 (\ac{FPKM}=0). Other genes with high
expression in the elephant placenta include genes involved in
oxidative stress (TXN), growth (IGF2), and PAEP, a gene usually
expressed in the endometrium of the uterus in humans (Rutanen et al.,
1987).

\end{table}

The top 50 expressed genes as measured by \ac{FPKM} in the term placenta of
the opossum are shown in Table 7 with a list of all genes in
Supplemental Table X. The gene with the highest expression
(\ac{FPKM}=41740.6) was hemoglobin, epsilon (HBE), which is expressed at
the embryonic stage of development in marsupials, as in other mammals
(Holland and Gooley, 1997). HBE subunits link up with protein products
of two hemoglobin, zeta (HBZ) genes, which are also expressed to a
high degree in the opossum placenta (\ac{FPKM}=2452.19 and \ac{FPKM}=1139.25).
In addition, there is high expression (\ac{FPKM}=5827.37) of the gene
hemoglobin, omega (HBO), a hemoglobin found only in marsupials and
monotremes (Opazo et al., 2008). The hemoglobin gene HBA is also
expressed in the placenta (\ac{FPKM}=456.978). The gene with the second
highest expression (\ac{FPKM}=22854.8) is superoxide dismutase 3,
extracellular (SOD3), which functions as an antioxidant. Four cystatin
genes (CSTB, CST3, two CSTA-like genes) are expressed to a high
degree, along with two cathepsin-L related genes (Table 7), which are
known to interact with cystatins (Turk et al., 2001). The
uncharacterized gene XM\_001364916.1 also shows high expression in the
opossum placenta (\ac{FPKM}=13572.8). The gene WFDC2, a member of the whey
acidic protein (WAP) family is also expressed to a high degree in the
opossum placenta. Other genes with high expression include genes
involved in retinol binding (RBP4), growth (IGFBP3), lipid metabolism
(APOA1, APOA2), and immunosupression (LGALS1). In addition, there was
little production of CYP19A1 and HSD3B1 (FPKM<2), and moderate
expression of relaxin RLN1 (\ac{FPKM}= 41.3949).

In order to identify major functional categories of genes expressed in
the individual transcriptomes, we undertook functional annotation
clustering analyses using DAVID (see Methods). Concentrating on genes
with relatively high expression values, we conducted DAVID analyses
using a list of genes with \ac{FPKM} values included within the top 5\%
distribution of expressed genes. Functional annotation clusters from
all six placenta transcriptomes show enrichment in similar clusters of
genes (Supplemental Table X). Significant enrichment in genes (ES>1.3,
p>0.05) in the top 5\% of \ac{FPKM} values in at least five transcriptomes
included clusters such as ribosome, vesicle, cytoskeleton,
glycoprotein, lysosome, annexins, hormone stimulus or response,
growth, calcium binding, cell migration, basement membrane,
antioxidant activity or oxidative stress, cell adhesion, and
mitochondrion among others (Supplemental Table X).

We also investigated enrichment in functional annotation clusters in
the top 100 genes of each transcriptome (Table 9). As in the analyses
of the top 5\% of genes, the top 100 genes show significant enrichment
(ES>1.3) in all six transcriptomes in genes associated with ribosomes.
Human shows enrichment in clusters such as collagen-binding, hormone
activity, female pregnancy, coagulation, and the defense response.
Bonobo shows enrichment in clusters related to apoptosis,
cytoskeleton-related genes, and the stress response. Cow shows only
four significantly enriched clusters; however many genes highly
expressed in the cow are ruminant-specific placenta genes and are not
yet annotated to specific GO categories. Dog shows enrichment in genes
associated with RNA, as well as homeostasis, glycoproteins, lyosome,
and calcium binding. Elephant shows enrichment in genes associated
with RNA, coagulation and calcium binding. Opossum shows enrichment in
genes involved in apoptosis, oxidative stress, mitochondrion, hormone
metabolism, and lipids.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis of Gene Expression}

We performed a comparative analysis of gene expression by
reconstructing the evolution of expression values and detecting
significant shifts in expression along specific lineages. Likelihood
values for each model for each of the X genes reconstructed, as well
as likelihood ratio tests, P- and Q-values (after correcting for
multiple testing) are shown in Supplemental Table X. We identified
between 4 (Boreoeutheria) and 550 (Mouse) significant shifts (Q <
0.01) in expression on specific lineages (Table 10). The top 10 genes
with significant shifts (if applicable) per lineage are shown in Table
10 and all genes for each branch are shown in Supplemental Tables
X-XX. Genes that showed shifts on the human lineage were
overwhelmingly identified as placenta-specific by the
tissue-specificity index (TSI), with 56 out of 279 genes (20\%) with
both TSI>0.75 and placenta as one the top two tissues with the highest
expression. Unsurpisingly, this was not the case with other lineages,
since we used expression values from a human-derived microarray to
generate TSI values for each gene. However, this does underscore the
dynamic nature of expression patterns in the placenta and indeed all
tissues across mammals.

We then performed DAVID functional annotation clustering analyses on
each list of genes from each lineage. The top three clusters for each
lineage are shown in Table 10 and a full list of clusters in
Supplemental Table X. The top enrichment cluster in the human lineage
is blood vessel development, followed by extracellular matrix and
metal ion binding (Table 10). Other significant clusters include those
related to cell communication/signaling, cytokines, defense response,
tryptophan metabolism, apoptosis, and skeletal system development
(Supplemental Table X). The bonobo lineage was enriched in only three
clusters: apoptosis, Toll-like receptor signalling and apoptosis. The
mouse displayed enrichment in clusters involved in epigenetic
modifications such as methyltransferase activity and histone
modification, as well embryonic morphogeneisis, lipid biosynthesis,
among others (Supplemental Table X). The top enriched cluster in the
cow lineage was the response to vitamin A, as well as many clusters
related to the immune system. The dog showed enrichment in skeletal
system development, as well as lipid metabolic processes and blood
circulation. The elephant lineage had only one enriched cluster:
carbohydrate binding. Genes that showed enrichment on the opossum
lineage (essentially representing the difference between placental
mammals and marsupials) were clustered in many categories not seen in
the other lineages, including clusters related to the mitochondria,
urea cycle, peroxisome, glycolysis, and transport across the cell
membrane (Table 10 and Supplemental Table X).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Evolution of Placental Hormones}

Reproductive hormones are central to the regulation of pregnancy and
their source, timing, and quantity can vary widely from species to
species \cite{Carter2012:Evolutionofplacentalfunction}. Expression and synthesis of hormones is
perhaps the most well-documented physiological process in the placenta
in many species. Here we quantified the extreme disparity in genes
with hormone products or enzymatic products that directly produce
hormones in multiple mammalian species (\DLA{Table 8}).

In both ruminants and primates, the placenta is responsible for the
production of estrogen and progesterone. High relative expression of
CYP19A1, the enzyme that synthesizes estrogen, and HSD3B1, the enzyme
that synthesizes progesterone, in the human, bonobo, and cow,
generally matches the high levels of placental production of estrogen
and progesterone in humans, other primates, and ruminants in late
pregnancy. In addition, HSD3B1 shows high levels in dog, which matches
the high levels of placental production of progesterone at term in
that species. \DLA{I think we need citations for this}

The elephant is strikingly the only mammal analyzed that shows high
expression of the primarily pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL) in the
placenta. %
\DLA{This is totally not true. \textit{A. fusciceps} expresses PRL,
  and so does \textit{S. carmeli}, and \textit{B. taurus}, \textit{M.
    musculus}, all have expansions of prolatacin.}
%
All afrotherians yet analyzed contain only one prolactin
gene, and prolactin has undergone adaptive evolution on the elephant
lineage \cite{Wallis2009:ProlactininAfrotheriacharacterization}.
\cite{Yamamoto.ea2011:PlacentationinAfricanelephant} noted the
presence of a prolactin in the trophoblast of the elephant placenta
using immunohistological staining and human derived antibodies. A
previous analysis of the elephant placenta also detected the
expression of prolactin (Hou et al., 2012). Here we confirm that the
sole prolactin in the elephant is not only expressed but highly
expressed in the placenta, and likely functions both in the
maintenance of the corpus luteum and as a placental lactogen \cite{Yamamoto.ea2011:PlacentationinAfricanelephant}. PRL is not expressed in the opossum, even though there
is evidence that it is expressed in the placenta of another marsupial,
the tammar wallaby \cite{Menzies.ea2011:Placentalexpressionofpituitary}. This suggests that
placental prolactin expression in marsupials may be as diverse as in
eutherian mammals. Although, PRL is not expressed to any great degree
in the placenta other mammals, we see very high expression of genes
which resulted from duplications of PRL in both the cow \DLA{(Table X)}, as
well as mouse \DLA{(Supplemental Table X)}. \DLA{Describe these}

The growth hormone (GH) family has expanded in anthropoid primates,
resulting in approximately 5 genes in humans (GH1, GH2, CSH1, CSH2,
CSHL1). All but GH1 show substantial expression in the placenta (Table
8). There is some evidence that increased expression of these genes
may be correlated with overall birth weight of offspring in humans
\DLA{(Mannik et al., 2010)}, and it is possible that the extreme expression
levels of these genes may be due to high birth weight. Ensembl
annotations show 4 GH genes present in the chimpanzee genome, and
three of these genes show high expression in bonobo, although to a
lesser degree than in human (Table 8). Human placental GH genes are
involved in increasing blood flow, replacing maternal pituitary
expression of GH, as well as trophoblast invasion \cite{Alsat.ea1998:Physiologicalroleofhuman,Lacroix.ea2005:Stimulationofhumantrophoblast,Schiessl.ea2007:Roleofplacentalgrowth}, and it is likely that
they have the same function in the bonobo.

The human gene CGA codes for the alpha subunit of multiple hormones
including pituitary hormones (luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone), as well as
numerous chorionic gonadotropins with variable beta subunits \cite{Maston.ea2002:Chorionicgonadotropinhasrecent}. The function of the chorionic gonadotropins is to
prevent the regression of the corpus luteum \cite{Hanson.ea1971:EffectsofHCGand}.
Among the six placentas we analyzed here, CGA is only expressed in the
placentas of humans and bonobos (\DLA{Table 8}), which corresponds with the
emergence of the chorionic gonadotropins in anthropoid primates
\cite{Maston.ea2002:Chorionicgonadotropinhasrecent}. However, oddly, CGA is expressed at much
higher levels in both species than the beta subunits with which its
product dimerizes (\DLA{Table 8}). CGA is one of several genes noted by
\cite{Uddin.ea2008:Distinctgenomicsignaturesof} to have undergone adaptive evolution of the
human-chimpanzee stem lineage.

Relaxin is a hormone that has multiple effects during pregnancy
including increasing maternal blood flow, widening the pubic bone and
relaxing uterine musculature in preparation for labor. In both dogs
and elephants, there is high expression of relaxin in the term
placenta, with little evidence in other species examined here (Table
8). Relaxin is known to be produced in the placenta of the pregnant
dog and is used in the diagnosis of canine pregnancy
\cite{Steinetz.ea1989:Serumrelaxinandprogesterone,Tsutsui.ea1991:Determinationofsourceof};
however, the source of relaxin produced by pregnant African elephants
remains unclear \cite{Meyer.ea2004:Speciesandfetalgender}. The high
rise in relaxin in elephants has been suggested to be a major signal
for the initiation of labor
\cite{Niemuller.ea1998:Plasmaconcentrationsofimmunoreactive} Here we
show that the placenta of elephants show high expression of relaxin
and is likely the predominant source of relaxin at term \DLA{(Table 8)}.

Two genes, NPPB and NPPC, code for peptide hormones that are important
in the inducement of vasodilation, and may be important in increasing
maternal blood flow to the fetus (Cameron et al., 1996). There is some
indication that these proteins are present in the decidua of mice
(Cameron et al., 1996), but we find very little expression in the
fetal portion of the mouse placenta (Table 8). Here we find high
expression of at least one of these genes in dog, cow, and elephant.
The lack of expression in the hemochorial placentas of
Euarchontoglires may mean that high expression of these genes are
essential in increasing maternal blood flow in epitheliochorial and
endotheliochorial placentas

\subsection{The Evolution of Placental Expression of Galectins}

\label{fig:galectins_lgals13_evolution_tree}
\end{figure}

Galectins are recognized as major regulators of pregnancy in both
fetal and maternal tissues (Than et al., 2012). Indeed, the evolution
of new lineage-specific galectins has occurred in both primates and
ruminants, with the genes LGALS13, LGALS14, and LGALS16 recognized as
being placenta-specific in humans and regulating immune responses by
inducing apoptosis of maternal T-cells (Than et al., 2009). Indeed,
LGALS14 has the highest expression of any galectin in the human
placenta (Table 8), and other primate galectins such as LGALS13 and
LGALS16 are also expressed in human placenta. However, in the closely
related bonobo, LGALS14 is not found, and LGALS1 is the most abundant
galectin. LGALS1 shows generally high expression in all placentas
analyzed. LGALS1 is also involved in mediating maternal-fetal immune
tolerance, and is expressed in both maternal and fetal tissue in
primates (Than et al., 2008). LGALS1 placental expression was thought
to be confined to eutherian mammals, as there is evidence of adaptive
evolution at this node, as well as the appearance of estrogen response
elements in eutherian cis-regulatory regions (Than et al., 2008). It
was unclear as to whether galectins such as LGALS1 were important in
the regulation of pregnancy in marsupials, as well as eutherians. Here
we show substantial expression of galectins in the opossum, especially
LGALS1 (Table 8). In addition, LGALS2, LGALS3, and LGALS8 are also
expressed. The presence of galectins at the maternal-fetal interface
in the opossum implies that it was also present in the ancestral
placenta of therian mammals. Indeed, adaptive evolution of LGALS1 on
the eutherian stem is likely due to the increased invasive nature of
eutehrian placentation rather than the origination of maternal-fetal
tolerance. Although the function of LGALS1 in the marsupial placenta
needs to be confirmed, it is likely that the mediation of
maternal-fetal immune tolerance by galectins is an ancient feature of
mammalian viviparity.

\subsection{The Opossum Placenta and the Evolution of Viviparity}

The placenta of the opossum Monodelphis domestica is distinctly
different from that of the term placenta of eutherian mammals in that
it is derived from both the chorion and yolk sac. Indeed other
differences between the placentas of marsupials and eutherians include
lack of invasive extravillous trophoblasts in marsupials, the
retention of a permeable shell coat for 2/3 of marsupial gestation,
and the greater degree of imprinting in placenta-expressed genes in
eutherians (Renfree, 2010; Renfree et al., 2013). In addition, the
placenta of Monodelphis is also distinct from other marsupials, in
that it is considered one of the least specialized, and thought be
closer to the original marsupial condition (Renfree, 2010). In
Monodelphis, the duration of direct connection between maternal and
fetal tissues is as short as two days in a gestational period of 13-15
days. During this period, the placenta is directly engaged in the
exchange of urea with maternal tissues, owing to the lack of a
vesicular allantois (Freyer et al., 2007). This differs drastically
with the situation in another well-studied marsupial, the tammar
wallaby (Freyer et al., 2007). Therefore, we must interpret
differences between the opossum and eutherian placentas with caution,
as highly expressed genes and functional annotation clusters may
represent didelphid or Monodelphis specific adaptations.

Genes that show a significant shift on the opossum lineage include
functional annotation clusters that correspond to active generation of
energy, transport, and lipid breakdown via the peroxisome (Table 10;
Supplemental Table X). The choriovitelline placenta of both didelphids
and the tammar wallaby are known to be involved in glycolysis and
protein synethsis (Freyer et al., 2003). This implies that the
choriovitelline placenta in marsupials is an active site of metabolism
and molecular synthesis, as well as the transport of nutrients from
the maternal tissues. This is a distinct difference that is not seen
in significant shifts on other lineages, and may be due to the
formation of the placenta in the opossum from the yolk sac. In
addition, the urea cycle is a highly enriched functional annotation
cluster which directly correlates with the high levels of urea in the
Monodelphis placenta (Freyer et al., 2007). This is potentially a
Monodelphis-specific characteristic as discussed above.

The opossum placenta shows expression of genes that either do not
exist in eutherians or are not found in the term eutherian placenta
(Table X). The existence of embryonic forms of hemoglobin in fetal
tissues at term, as evidenced by the expression of HBE, HBZ, and HBO
is a feature of marsupials that is generally due to their very short
gestation periods. Embryonic hemoglobins in marsupials have a lower
affinity for oxygen and allow for a lower rate of oxygen uptake from
maternal tissues (Holland and Gooley, 1997). One novel uncharacterized
gene that shows high expression (XM\_001364916.1) is not found in
eutherians; Ensembl gene trees reveal that homologs of this gene exist
in other amniotes such as birds and turtles, but are not present in
eutherian mammals. The homolog of this gene in chicken is found to
expressed in reproductive tract (Froman et al., 2006), but its
function is unknown. WFDC2 is a member of the whey acidic protein
(WAP) family and involved in innate immunity. It is expressed in the
mammary gland of the tammar wallaby during pregnancy and early
lactation (Sharp et al., 2007), and here in abundance in the opossum
placenta.

\subsection{Novel Gene Expansions in the Elephant Placenta}

We found evidence of high expression in two novel expansions of genes
in the elephant genome. One family includes 11 genes that are related
to the gene PRSS16 gene, a thymus-specific serine protease that may be
involved regulating the presentation of self-peptides in CD4+
T-lymphocytes (Fornari et al., 2012). All 11 of these genes are
expressed in the elephant placenta, three of which have very abundant
mRNAs (Table 6). It is possible that this elephant-specific gene
family may be involved in immunity in the elephant placenta and the
mediation of maternal-fetal immune tolerance; however, future work
will need to test these hypotheses. Three other genes abundantly
expressed in the elephant placenta are homologues of SSLP1, a gene
with predominant expression in the seminal vesicle in mouse (Li et
al., 2006). Homologues of SSLP1 have been identified as being
expressed in the placental villi of cow, sheep, and goat. SSLP1 also
contains an Alu retrotransposon and may be involved in the development
of villi via cell proliferation (Ushizawa et al., 2009, 2010). We
verified expression in cow, however its abundant expression was also
identified in dog. This gene is not found in primates. Expansion of
these genes in elephants may indicate an elaboration of this system.

\subsection{Human Specific Expression Shifts and the Evolution of Preeclampsia}

The human placenta is distinctive from many other primates in that it
possesses a deeply invasive trophoblast that penetrates the inner
myometrium of the uterus \cite{Carter.ea2011:Evolutionofinvasiveplacentation}. It is
hypothesized that this feature is related to the increased demand for
resources by the developing fetus to feed the expanded size of the
human brain (Carter and Pijnenborg, 2011; Robillard et al., 2002).
Humans have the largest brain in terms of relative size and this
differs markedly from closely related great apes (Boddy et al., 2012).
Deep penetration of the myometrium occurs in chimpanzees and gorillas,
but this penetration may be accelerated in humans (Carter and
Pijnenborg, 2011).

The near exclusivity of deep trophoblast invasion in humans has also
led many to speculate on the origin of various disorders, which are
almost exclusively symptomatic of human pregnancy. For example,
preeclampsia is a human disease that occurs in 4\% of pregnancies in
the United States. Preeclampsia can be attributed to the lack of
adequate invasion of maternal tissue, and is noted by the onset of
hypertension and proteinuria (citation). Some cases of preeclampsia
can develop into eclampsia, a more severe condition resulting in
seizures during pregnancy and death. Lack of invasion in preeclampsia
may be attributed to the inefficiency of growth regulators as well as
the inability to sufficiently suppress the maternal immune response.
Although there are speculative cases of eclampsia in great apes
(Baird, 1981; Stout and Lemmon, 1969; Thornton and Onwude, 1992), it
is exceedingly rare in these species \cite{Carter.ea2011:Evolutionofinvasiveplacentation}. It
is possible that a comparative evolutionary approach to gene
expression can identify genes that have divergent expression patterns
from other mammals as well as association with preeclampsia.

Functional annotation clusters significantly enriched on the human
lineage (blood vessel development, extracellular matrix, tube
morphogenesis) seem to suggest involvement in remodeling of tissues
and increased blood flow, both of which may correlate with the
invasion of the trophoblast (Table 8; Supplemental Table X). In
addition, clusters such as cytokines and defense response
(Supplemental Table X) also indicate an a significant change in
expression of the immune response that may be involved in
immunosupression at the maternal-fetal boundary to further allow
invasion of fetal tissues.

Many genes that both show expression shifts on the human lineage and
have very high expression (FPKM>200) are directly related to the
highly invasive nature of the human placenta. For example, GPC3,
glypican 3, is an imprinted gene and cell growth regulator, associated
with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel fetal overgrowth syndrome, and involved in
intrauterine growth restriction (Monk and Moore, 2004; Pilia et al.,
1996). GPC3 has the highest expression in humans (Table 2), but is
also expressed in other mammals to a lesser degree, especially those
with invasive hemochorial placentas like bonobos (\ac{FPKM}= 199.924),
spider monkeys (\ac{FPKM}= 96.24), and the mouse (\ac{FPKM}= 80.7545)
(Supplemental Tables X-XX). ADAM12 increases the availability of
insulin-like growth factors that lead to the promotion of cell growth
and placental invasion (Laigaard et al., 2005). (Hou et al., 2009)
found evidence of adaptive evolution in ADAM12 on the primate lineage,
and like GPC3 it is expressed in the bonobo (\ac{FPKM}= 46.1553), spider
monkey (\ac{FPKM}=30.41) and mouse (\ac{FPKM}=2.25391) as well, although to a
lesser degree (Supplemental Tables X-XX). RHOBTB3 is imprinted and
associated with trophoblast invasion as well (Bilban et al., 2010;
Yuen et al., 2011). In addition, one other gene, KISS1, shows
exceptional abundance in the human placenta (Table 2); however due to
its absence in elephant Ensmebl gene annotations, it was not part of
the 1:1 orthologues examined in the comparative study. Here, it is
only expressed in the term placentas of humans (Table 2) and bonobos
(\ac{FPKM}=17.6394; Supplemental Table X). KISS1 is thought to be involved
in the regulation of trophoblast invasion, and shows highest
expression in the first trimester of pregnancy (Bilban et al., 2004;
Reynolds et al., 2009).

In addition, several other genes that show expression shifts on the
human lineage also have major effects on placental function. Genes
such as TXK and EBI3 are intimately involved in the immune system in
the placenta. TXK is involved in natural killer cell differentiation
(Bezman et al., 2012). EBI3 is implicated in natural killer cell
function an maternal-fetal immunomodulation in the syncytiotrophoblast
(Devergne et al., 2001). KYNU and KMO are interacting genes that are
involved in tryptophan metabolism, which may be involved in
immunosupression and the prevention of fetal rejection (Takikawa,
2005). THSD7A is a thrombospondin, which inhibits endothelial cell
migration and tube morphogenesis (Wang et al., 2010).

Many genes that show evidence of a shift on the human lineage show
evidence of implication in preeclampsia, including ADAM12 (Gack et
al., 2005; Laigaard et al., 2005) MAOA (Carrasco et al., 2000;
Bottalico et al., 2004), BCL2 (Ishihara et al., 2002), GPC3 (Gui et
al., 2012; Ogawa, 2007), TMEM8A, CLIC3, EBI3, FLT1, BCL6, SYDE1, and
MAN1C1 (Enquobahrie et al., 2008; Winn et al., 2009; Nishizawa, 2011).
In addition KISS1 is also involved in preeclampsia as well (Sado et
al., 2011; Qiao et al, 2012). Due to the association of many genes
that show human-specific shifts as well as high expression, we
conclude that preeclampsia is possibly a symptom of recent evolution
of gene expression on the human lineage. Although many genes such as
GPC3 and ADAM12 show distinctive relatively high expression in bonobo,
this expression has intensified on the human lineage. Sequencing of
more placentas of nonhuman primates, including other individuals of
the genus Pan will help to further characterize this transition.

\section{Conclusion}
    
Here we sequenced six placentas spanning the phylogenetic tree of
mammals. This revealed a dynamic expression pattern of expression of
lineage-specific expansions of gene families and differential gene
expression that agreed with the scenario of an âarms raceâ between
maternal and fetal tissues that have shaped such disparate gene
expression profiles. In addition, we highlighted the broad spectrum of
hormone gene expression in multiple species that suggested that there
was a lack of conservation in hormone signaling during mammalian
pregnancy. Major differences between expression in marsupial and
eutherian mammals at term seemed to be correlated with the differences
between choriovitelline and chorioamniotic placenta, with the
marsupial placenta more enriched in genes the contributed to the
active generation of energy. We also identified that galectin
expression, especially that of LGALS1, is a common feature of all
mammalian placentas and was most likely present in the ancestral
therian. Also, we identified two new expansions of genes that are
highly expressed in the elephant placenta hat may be involved in
trophoplast differentiation and immune system function, mirroring
expansions in other groups such as primates, rodents, and ruminants.
We also quantified significant lineage-specific shifts in gene
expression, concentrating on the identification of genes that showed
gene expression changes on the human lineage. We cautiously propose
that many of these genes may be related to the invasive nature of the
trophoblast in humans, although we note that in many of these genes,
there is in some cases substantial expression in the bonobo as well.
These genes have the potential to spur further research and may be at
the root of obstetrical disorders such as preeclampsia. We propose
that more placentas from diverse lineages, especially those of
marsupials and primates, to further identify genes and expression
levels that are specific to marsupials and eutehrians, as well as
confirm the identity of human-specific expression shifts.
