  ABSTRACT = {The mammalian placenta exhibits striking interspecific morphological variation, yet the implications of such diversity for reproductive strategies and fetal development remain obscure. More invasive hemochorial placentas, in which fetal tissues directly contact the maternal blood supply, are believed to facilitate nutrient transfer, resulting in higher fetal growth rates, and to be a state of relative fetal advantage in the evolution of maternal-offspring conflict. The extent of interdigitation between maternal and fetal tissues has received less attention than invasiveness but is also potentially important because it influences the surface area for exchange. We show that although increased placental invasiveness and interdigitation are both associated with shorter gestations, interdigitation is the key variable. Gestation times associated with highly interdigitated labyrinthine placentas are 44\% of those associated with less interdigitated villous and trabecular placentas. There is, however, no relationship between placental traits and neonatal body and brain size. Hence, species with more interdigitated placentas produce neonates of similar body and brain size but in less than half the time. We suggest that the effects of placental interdigitation on growth rates and the way that these are traded off against gestation length may be promising avenues for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of parent-offspring conflict.},

@ARTICLE{Carter2012:Evolutionofplacentalfunction,
  ABSTRACT = {Placenta has a wide range of functions. Some are supported by novel genes that have evolved following gene duplication events while others require acquisition of gene expression by the trophoblast. Although not expressed in the placenta, high-affinity fetal hemoglobins play a key role in placental gas exchange. They evolved following duplications within the beta-globin gene family with convergent evolution occurring in ruminants and primates. In primates there was also an interesting rearrangement of a cassette of genes in relation to an upstream locus control region. Substrate transfer from mother to fetus is maintained by expression of classic sugar and amino acid transporters at the trophoblast microvillous and basal membranes. In contrast, placental peptide hormones have arisen largely by gene duplication, yielding for example chorionic gonadotropins from the luteinizing hormone gene and placental lactogens from the growth hormone and prolactin genes. There has been a remarkable degree of convergent evolution with placental lactogens emerging separately in the ruminant, rodent, and primate lineages and chorionic gonadotropins evolving separately in equids and higher primates. Finally, coevolution in the primate lineage of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors and human leukocyte antigens can be linked to the deep invasion of the uterus by trophoblast that is a characteristic feature of human placentation.},

@ARTICLE{Knox.ea2008:Genomicevolutionofplacenta,
  ABSTRACT = {The invention of the placenta facilitated the evolution of mammals. How the placenta evolved from the simple structure observed in birds and reptiles into the complex organ that sustains human life is one of the great mysteries of evolution. By using a timecourse microarray analysis including the entire lifetime of the placenta, we uncover molecular and genomic changes that underlie placentation and find that two distinct evolutionary mechanisms were utilized during placental evolution in mice and human. Ancient genes involved in growth and metabolism were co-opted for use during early embryogenesis, likely enabling the accelerated development of extraembryonic tissues. Recently duplicated genes are utilized at later stages of placentation to meet the metabolic needs of a diverse range of pregnancy physiologies. Together, these mechanisms served to develop the specialized placenta, a novel structure that led to expansion of the eutherian mammal, including humankind.},

  ABSTRACT = {High-throughput gene expression profiling has become an important tool for investigating transcriptional activity in a variety of biological samples. To date, the vast majority of these experiments have focused on specific biological processes and perturbations. Here, we have generated and analyzed gene expression from a set of samples spanning a broad range of biological conditions. Specifically, we profiled gene expression from 91 human and mouse samples across a diverse array of tissues, organs, and cell lines. Because these samples predominantly come from the normal physiological state in the human and mouse, this dataset represents a preliminary, but substantial, description of the normal mammalian transcriptome. We have used this dataset to illustrate methods of mining these data, and to reveal insights into molecular and physiological gene function, mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, disease etiology, and comparative genomics. Finally, to allow the scientific community to use this resource, we have built a free and publicly accessible website (http://expression.gnf.org) that integrates data visualization and curation of current gene annotations.},

@ARTICLE{Hou.ea2012:Elephanttranscriptomeprovidesinsights,
  ABSTRACT = {The chorioallantoic placenta connects mother and fetus in eutherian pregnancies. In order to understand the evolution of the placenta and provide further understanding of placenta biology, we sequenced the transcriptome of a term placenta of an African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and compared these data with RNA sequence and microarray data from other eutherian placentas including human, mouse, and cow. We characterized the composition of 55,910 expressed sequence tag (i.e., cDNA) contigs using our custom annotation pipeline. A Markov algorithm was used to cluster orthologs of human, mouse, cow, and elephant placenta transcripts. We found 2,963 genes are commonly expressed in the placentas of these eutherian mammals. Gene ontology categories previously suggested to be important for placenta function (e.g., estrogen receptor signaling pathway, cell motion and migration, and adherens junctions) were significantly enriched in these eutherian placenta-expressed genes. Genes duplicated in different lineages and also specifically expressed in the placenta contribute to the great diversity observed in mammalian placenta anatomy. We identified 1,365 human lineage-specific, 1,235 mouse lineage-specific, 436 cow lineage-specific, and 904 elephant-specific placenta-expressed (PE) genes. The most enriched clusters of human-specific PE genes are signal/glycoprotein and immunoglobulin, and humans possess a deeply invasive human hemochorial placenta that comes into direct contact with maternal immune cells. Inference of phylogenetically conserved and derived transcripts demonstrates the power of comparative transcriptomics to trace placenta evolution and variation across mammals and identified candidate genes that may be important in the normal function of the human placenta, and their dysfunction may be related to human pregnancy complications.},

@ARTICLE{Green.ea2000:Pregnancy-associatedbovineandovine,
  ABSTRACT = {The pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) constitute a large family of recently duplicated genes. They show structural resemblance to pepsin and related aspartic proteinases. A total of 21 bovine (bo) PAG and 9 ovine (ov) PAG cDNA have been identified. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PAG are divided into two main groupings that accurately reflect their tissue expression, as determined by in situ hybridization. In the first pattern, represented by ovPAG-2 and boPAG-2, -8, -10, and -11 (where the numbering is arbitrary and reflects order of discovery within species), expression occurred throughout the outer epithelial layer of the placenta (trophectoderm). The second pattern was predominant localization to binucleate cells. Ribonuclease protection assays, which allow discrimination between closely related transcripts, have shown that the expression of PAG varies in a temporal manner over pregnancy. Of those bovine PAG expressed predominantly in binucleate cells, boPAG-1, -6, and -7 are expressed weakly, if at all, by Day 25 placenta, but are present at the middle and end of pregnancy. Others, such as boPAG-4, -5, and -9, are expressed at Day 25 and at earlier stages. Although not among the earliest PAG produced by the trophoblast, boPAG-1 has been used for pregnancy diagnosis, particularly in dairy cows, where there is a major need for a sensitive method capable of detecting pregnancy within 1 mo of conception. It seems likely that some of the newly discovered PAG will be better candidates than PAG-1 for pregnancy diagnosis.},

  ABSTRACT = {A number of placenta-specific genes (e.g., Tpbp, Plac1, Syncytin, and retrotransposon-associated genes such as Peg10, Rtl1, Endothelin B receptor, Insl4, Leptin, Midline1, and Pleiotrophin), enhancer elements (e.g., glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit) and gene isoforms (e.g., 3betaHSD, Cyp19), as well as placenta-specific members of gene families (e.g., Gcm1, Mash2, Rhox, Esx1, Cathepsin, PAG, TKDP, Psg, Siglec) have been identified. This review summarizes their evolution, regulation, and biochemical functions and discusses their significance for placental development and function. Strikingly, the number of unique, truly placenta-specific genes that have been discovered to date is very small. The vast majority of placenta-specific gene products have resulted from one of three mechanisms: evolution of placenta-specific promoters, evolution of large gene families with several placenta-specific members, or adoption of functions associated with endogenous retroviruses and retroelements. Interestingly, nearly all the examples of placenta-specific genes that have been discovered to date are not present in all placental mammals.},

  ABSTRACT = {Many questions about the regulation, functional specialization, computational prediction, and evolution of genomic imprinting would be better addressed by having an exhaustive genome-wide catalog of genes that display parent-of-origin differential expression. As a first-pass scan for novel imprinted genes, we performed mRNA-seq experiments on embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) mouse placenta cDNA samples from reciprocal cross F1 progeny of AKR and PWD mouse strains and quantified the allele-specific expression and the degree of parent-of-origin allelic imbalance. We confirmed the imprinting status of 23 known imprinted genes in the placenta and found that 12 genes reported previously to be imprinted in other tissues are also imprinted in mouse placenta. Through a well-replicated design using an orthogonal allelic-expression technology, we verified 5 novel imprinted genes that were not previously known to be imprinted in mouse (Pde10, Phf17, Phactr2, Zfp64, and Htra3). Our data suggest that most of the strongly imprinted genes have already been identified, at least in the placenta, and that evidence supports perhaps 100 additional weakly imprinted genes. Despite previous appearance that the placenta tends to display an excess of maternally expressed imprinted genes, with the addition of our validated set of placenta-imprinted genes, this maternal bias has disappeared.},

@ARTICLE{Hughes.ea2015:Evaluatingintra-andinter-individual,
  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Gene expression variation is a phenotypic trait of particular interest as it represents the initial link between genotype and other phenotypes. Analyzing how such variation apportions among and within groups allows for the evaluation of how genetic and environmental factors influence such traits. It also provides opportunities to identify genes and pathways that may have been influenced by non-neutral processes. Here we use a population genetics framework and next generation sequencing to evaluate how gene expression variation is apportioned among four human groups in a natural biological tissue, the placenta. RESULTS: We estimate that on average, 33.2\%, 58.9\%, and 7.8\% of the placental transcriptome is explained by variation within individuals, among individuals, and among human groups, respectively. Additionally, when technical and biological traits are included in models of gene expression they each account for roughly 2\% of total gene expression variation. Notably, the variation that is significantly different among groups is enriched in biological pathways associated with immune response, cell signaling, and metabolism. Many biological traits demonstrate correlated changes in expression in numerous pathways of potential interest to clinicians and evolutionary biologists. Finally, we estimate that the majority of the human placental transcriptome exhibits expression profiles consistent with neutrality; the remainder are consistent with stabilizing selection, directional selection, or diversifying selection. CONCLUSIONS: We apportion placental gene expression variation into individual, population, and biological trait factors and identify how each influence the transcriptome. Additionally, we advance methods to associate expression profiles with different forms of selection.},

@ARTICLE{Coleman.ea2010:Structuralannotationofequine,
  ABSTRACT = {The horse, like the majority of animal species, has a limited amount of species-specific expressed sequence data available in public databases. As a result, structural models for the majority of genes defined in the equine genome are predictions based on ab initio sequence analysis or the projection of gene structures from other mammalian species. The current study used Illumina-based sequencing of messenger RNA (RNA-seq) to help refine structural annotation of equine protein-coding genes and for a preliminary assessment of gene expression patterns. Sequencing of mRNA from eight equine tissues generated 293,758105 sequence tags of 35 bases each, equalling 10.28 gbp of total sequence data. The tag alignments represent approximately 207 × coverage of the equine mRNA transcriptome and confirmed transcriptional activity for roughly 90\% of the protein-coding gene structures predicted by Ensembl and NCBI. Tag coverage was sufficient to refine the structural annotation for 11,356 of these predicted genes, while also identifying an additional 456 transcripts with exon/intron features that are not listed by either Ensembl or NCBI. Genomic locus data and intervals for the protein-coding genes predicted by the Ensembl and NCBI annotation pipelines were combined with 75,116 RNA-seq-derived transcriptional units to generate a consensus equine protein-coding gene set of 20,302 defined loci. Gene ontology annotation was used to compare the functional and structural categories of genes expressed in either a tissue-restricted pattern or broadly across all tissue samples.},

This aims to foster future participation from across the research community through the coordinated activities of the consortium. The review also serves as a 'marker paper' by providing information concerning the pre-publication release of the reference genome.

@ARTICLE{Ahanda.ea2012:Predictionofaltered3-,
  ABSTRACT = {THE SLA (swine leukocyte antigen, MHC: SLA) genes are the most important determinants of immune, infectious disease and vaccine response in pigs; several genetic associations with immunity and swine production traits have been reported. However, most of the current knowledge on SLA is limited to gene coding regions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of a large number of protein-coding genes in metazoans, and are suggested to play important roles in fine-tuning immune mechanisms and disease responses. Polymorphisms in either miRNAs or their gene targets may have a significant impact on gene expression by abolishing, weakening or creating miRNA target sites, possibly leading to phenotypic variation. We explored the impact of variants in the 3'-UTR miRNA target sites of genes within the whole SLA region. The combined predictions by TargetScan, PACMIT and TargetSpy, based on different biological parameters, empowered the identification of miRNA target sites and the discovery of polymorphic miRNA target sites (poly-miRTSs). Predictions for three SLA genes characterized by a different range of sequence variation provided proof of principle for the analysis of poly-miRTSs from a total of 144 M RNA-Seq reads collected from different porcine tissues. Twenty-four novel SNPs were predicted to affect miRNA-binding sites in 19 genes of the SLA region. Seven of these genes (SLA-1, SLA-6, SLA-DQA, SLA-DQB1, SLA-DOA, SLA-DOB and TAP1) are linked to antigen processing and presentation functions, which is reminiscent of associations with disease traits reported for altered miRNA binding to MHC genes in humans. An inverse correlation in expression levels was demonstrated between miRNAs and co-expressed SLA targets by exploiting a published dataset (RNA-Seq and small RNA-Seq) of three porcine tissues. Our results support the resource value of RNA-Seq collections to identify SNPs that may lead to altered miRNA regulation patterns.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites. RESULTS: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.

Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome to study its evolutionary relationship with the chimpanzee and human genomes. We find that more than three per cent of the human genome is more closely related to either the bonobo or the chimpanzee genome than these are to each other. These regions allow various aspects of the ancestry of the two ape species to be reconstructed. In addition, many of the regions that overlap genes may eventually help us understand the genetic basis of phenotypes that humans share with one of the two apes to the exclusion of the other.},

  ABSTRACT = {Genomic experiments produce multiple views of biological systems, among them are DNA sequence and copy number variation, and mRNA and protein abundance. Understanding these systems needs integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public databases such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the relevant sets of probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can be biologically complex and the content of the databases is dynamic. We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene-to-transcript-to-protein mappings. The approach provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for state-of-the-art bioinformatic data integration.},

@ARTICLE{Benjamini1995:bh_procedure,
  ABSTRACT = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There- fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni- type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  ABSTRACT = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

@ARTICLE{Petsas.ea2012:Aberrantexpressionofcorticotropin-releasing,
  ABSTRACT = {Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its receptors are expressed in human placenta. Recently, the impaired function of this system has been associated with a number of complications of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that CRH participates in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia through the induction of macrophage-mediated apoptosis of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). We found that the expression of CRH was increased in the EVT of the placental bed biopsy specimens from pre-eclamptic pregnancies (1.8-fold increase; P < 0.05). In addition, significantly larger numbers of apoptotic EVT were detected in pre-eclamptic placentas compared with normal ones (P < 0.05), and only in pre-eclamptic placentas, decidual macrophages were found to be Fas ligand (FasL)-positive. In vitro studies on the effect of CRH on human macrophages suggested that CRH induced the expression of the FasL protein in human macrophages and potentiated their ability to induce the apoptosis of a Fas-expressing EVT-based hybridoma cell line in co-cultures. These findings demonstrate a possible mechanism by which the aberrant expression of CRH in pre-eclampsia may activate the FasL-positive decidual macrophages, impair the physiological turnover of EVT and eventually disturb placentation.},

@ARTICLE{Paiva.ea2011:MeasurementofmRNAtranscripts,
  ABSTRACT = {CONTEXT: mRNA of placental origin in maternal blood shows potential as a clinical biomarker of obstetric diseases such as preeclampsia (PE). We hypothesized that mRNA transcripts very highly expressed in the placenta relative to other tissues will be differentially expressed in PE and be useful as mRNA biomarkers in maternal blood. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify a panel of genes highly expressed in the placenta and compare their expression in placenta and maternal whole blood from PE vs. control pregnancies. SETTING: Placental tissue and maternal whole blood specimens were obtained from normotensive controls (n = 15) and pregnancies complicated by severe preterm PE (n = 21). INTERVENTION: mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We identified 20 genes exhibiting highest to fourth highest expression in the placenta relative to all other tissues. All genes were detectable in placenta. Nine of the 20 genes were detectable in maternal whole blood. Four of the nine genes detectable in blood (i.e. PLAC3, PLAC4, CRH, and ERVWE1) were significantly increased in both maternal blood and placenta from PE pregnancies. The remaining five genes detectable in maternal blood were unchanged in both blood and placenta from PE pregnancies. Thus, there was complete correlation of gene expression between maternal blood and placenta. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating mRNA coding genes of high placental expression show strong correlation with transcript levels in preeclamptic placenta. Such transcripts may be promising candidates to screen as mRNA biomarkers of PE in maternal whole blood.},

@ARTICLE{Vazquez-Alaniz.ea2011:Comparativeexpressionprofilesfor,
  ABSTRACT = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to look at differences in the placental tissue expression of KiSS-1 and REN genes from preeclamptic and healthy pregnant women, that could account for a possible synergistic function for both genes in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study involved 27 preeclamptic women and 27 normoevolutive pregnant women. cDNA was obtained from placental tissue to carry out qPCR for both KiSS-1 and REN genes in order to compare mRNA expression levels in the studied groups. Statistical analysis showed expression differences that correlate with clinical and/or biochemical variables. RESULTS: Higher expression for KiSS-1 in PEE vs. control woman (p=0.001) was observed, whereas no difference was observed for REN expression (p=0.300) when all the subjects were included. However, REN expression was significant higher when the samples were stratified according to preeclampsia severity. For 18 mild preeclamptic patients the p-value was p=0.001 compared to their controls, while for the remaining nine with severe preeclampsia the expression became significant (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the high KiSS-1 expression seen in preeclamptic patients is in accordance with its role as an inhibitor of trophoblast invasiveness and maintained until the end of gestation. On the other hand, aggressive therapeutic management and/or severity status of patients have a direct effect on placental REN expression levels, masking the natural high expression of this gene on preeclamptic placental tissue. Therefore it was not possible to establish a real concordant expression profile for KiSS-1 and REN genes.},

@ARTICLE{Spencer.ea2008:ADAM12sinmaternalserum,
  ABSTRACT = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether maternal serum ADAM12s, a potential first- and second-trimester marker of fetal aneuploidy and fetal growth, had altered concentrations in the first or second trimester of pregnancies subsequently developing pre-eclampsia. METHODS: ADAM12s was measured by a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay developed by PerkinElmer Life Science. Maternal serum samples from women taking part in early first-trimester aneuploidy screening in whom the pregnancy resulted in pre-eclampsia (64) were identified from a cohort of 4,390 singleton pregnancies in which uterine artery Doppler mean Pulsatility Index (PI) had been measured at 22-24 weeks. From amongst those cases delivering a normal term infant with birth weight greater than the 10th centile for gestational age 240 cases were selected as gestational age-matched controls. A second study group consisting of maternal serum taken at 22-24 weeks at the time of uterine artery Doppler in a group of 12 women developing pre-eclampsia were compared with 86 matched controls from a previously studied cohort of 24 cases and 144 controls. Serum ADAM12s concentrations were converted to multiple of the median (MoM) to take account of gestational age variation. RESULTS: First-trimester maternal serum ADAM12s levels in women who developed pre-eclampsia were reduced with a median MoM of 0.71 which was further reduced in those delivering prior to 35 weeks (0.50). At the 5th centile of normal (0.48 MoM) ADAM12s identified 27\% of cases with pre-eclampsia and 47\% of those with early pre-eclampsia. Combining ADAM12s with PAPP-A from a previous study only resulted in a further 1\% increase in detection of all women developing pre-eclampsia. However combining ADAM12s with mean PI increased the detection rate to 66\%. In the second trimester at 22-24 weeks the maternal serum ADAM12s levels were increased in those women developing pre-eclampsia compared to controls (709 vs 486 ug/L, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: ADAM12s in addition to being a potential marker of aneuploidy may also be a marker of pre-eclampsia. Further studies are required to see if this can improve on the clinical discrimination already provided by PAPP-A in the early first trimester.},

Identification of these genes facilitates exposure of the underlying cellular infrastructure and increases understanding of various structural genomic features. In addition, housekeeping genes are instrumental for calibration in many biotechnological applications and genomic studies. Advances in our ability to measure RNA expression have resulted in a gradual increase in the number of identified housekeeping genes. Here, we describe housekeeping gene detection in the era of massive parallel sequencing and RNA-seq. We emphasize the importance of expression at a constant level and provide a list of 3804 human genes that are expressed uniformly across a panel of tissues. Several exceptionally uniform genes are singled out for future experimental use, such as RT-PCR control genes. Finally, we discuss both ways in which current technology can meet some of past obstacles encountered, and several as yet unmet challenges.},

  ABSTRACT = {Inflammatory processes are central to reproductive events including ovulation, menstruation, implantation and labour, while inflammatory dysregulation is a feature of numerous reproductive pathologies. In recent years, there has been much research into the endogenous mechanisms by which inflammatory reactions are terminated and tissue homoeostasis is restored, a process termed resolution. The identification and characterisation of naturally occurring pro-resolution mediators including lipoxins and annexin A1 has prompted a shift in the field of anti-inflammation whereby resolution is now observed as an active process, triggered as part of a normal inflammatory response. This review will address the process of resolution, discuss available evidence for expression of pro-resolution factors in the reproductive tract and explore possible roles for resolution in physiological reproductive processes and associated pathologies.},

@ARTICLE{Liu.ea2015:AnnexinA2complexeswith,
  ABSTRACT = {Annexin A2 (AnxA2) was originally identified as a substrate of the pp60v-src oncoprotein in transformed chicken embryonic fibroblasts. It is an abundant protein that associates with biological membranes as well as the actin cytoskeleton, and has been implicated in intracellular vesicle fusion, the organization of membrane domains, lipid rafts and membrane-cytoskeleton contacts. In addition to an intracellular role, AnxA2 has been reported to participate in processes localized to the cell surface including extracellular protease regulation and cell-cell interactions. There are many reports showing that AnxA2 is differentially expressed between normal and malignant tissue and potentially involved in tumour progression. An important aspect of AnxA2 function relates to its interaction with small Ca(2+) -dependent adaptor proteins called S100 proteins, which is the topic of this review. The interaction between AnxA2 and S100A10 has been very well characterized historically; more recently, other S100 proteins have been shown to interact with AnxA2 as well. The biochemical evidence for the occurrence of these protein interactions will be discussed, as well as their function. Recent studies aiming to generate inhibitors of S100 protein interactions will be described and the potential of these inhibitors to further our understanding of AnxA2 S100 protein interactions will be discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {PROBLEM: To determine whether down-regulation of TIMP3 expression promotes TACE expression and increases in TNFα production by placental trophoblast cells. METHOD OF STUDY: Placental expression of TIMP3 and TACE was examined by immunostaining and Western blot. Effects of TIMP3 on TACE expression and TNFα production were assessed by transfection of TIMP3 siRNA into trophoblasts isolated from normal placentas. Effects of oxidative stress on trophoblast TIMP3 expression and TNFα production were also determined. Trophoblast production of TIMP3, TACE and TNFα were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: TIMP3 expression was markedly reduced in preeclamptic placentas compared with normal placentas; oxidative stress down-regulated trophoblast TIMP3 expression and production, P < 0.01. Down-regulation of TIMP3 expression by TIMP3 siRNA resulted in significant increases in TACE expression and TNFα production, P < 0.01. CONCLUSION: As TIMP3 is an endogenous TACE inhibitor, down-regulation of trophoblast TIMP3 expression/activity could result in increased TACE expression and subsequently lead to increased TNFα production in preeclamptic placentas.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antiphospholipid syndrome is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and pregnancy loss. Annexin A5 (Anxa5) is a candidate autoantigen. It is not known, however, whether endogenous Anxa5 prevents foetal loss during normal pregnancy. We found significant reductions in litter size and foetal weight in Anxa5-null mice (Anxa5-KO). These changes occurred even when only the mother was Anxa5-KO. A small amount of placental fibrin deposition was observed in the decidual tissues, but did not noticeably differ between wild-type and Anxa5-KO mice. However, immunoreactivity for integrin beta 3/CD61, a platelet marker, was demonstrated within thrombi in the arterial canals only in Anxa5-KO mothers. Subcutaneous administration of the anticoagulant heparin to pregnant Anxa5-KO mice significantly reduced pregnancy loss, suggesting that maternal Anxa5 is crucial for maintaining intact placental circulation. Hence, the presence of maternal Anxa5 minimises the risk of thrombosis in the placental circulation and reduces the risk of foetal loss.},

We show that UNC93B specifically interacts with TLR3, 7, 9, and 13, whereas introduction of the point mutation H412R in UNC93B abolishes their interactions. We establish the physical interaction of the intracellular TLRs with UNC93B in splenocytes and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Further, by expressing chimeric TLRs, we show that TLR3 and 9 bind to UNC93B via their transmembrane domains. We propose that a physical association between UNC93B and TLRs in the ER is essential for proper TLR signaling.},

@ARTICLE{Wildman.ea2006:Evolutionofmammalianplacenta,
  ABSTRACT = {The placenta is essential for the success of therian mammalian reproduction. Intense selective pressure has shaped changes in placental anatomy and function during mammalian cladogenesis. Here we challenge the view that the hemochorial placenta is a derived feature in haplorhine primates. Using phylogenetic and statistical analyses of molecular and morphological data, we demonstrate that the ancestral eutherian mammalian placenta had the distinctive features of (i) hemochorial placental interface, (ii) a discoid shape, and (iii) a labyrinthine maternofetal interdigitation. These results reveal that the first eutherians had a deeply invasive placenta and imply that the major role of the placenta in sustaining pregnancy and promoting gestational development existed throughout the eutherian lineage that descended to humans from the last common ancestor of placental mammals. The ancestral state reconstructions demonstrate both clade-specific patterns of placentation and specific cases of convergent evolution within individual eutherian clades. Determining the mammalian pattern of change in placental morphology is important for understanding the evolutionary pressures faced by these lineages. The effects of selection pressures on the efficiency of placentation may stem from changes in nutritional demand, gestational length, number of embryos per pregnancy, uterine shape, and maternal body constitution. The influence of these factors on placental development needs further investigation.},

  ABSTRACT = {It is now possible to view human placentation in an evolutionary context because advances in molecular phylogenetics provide a reliable scenario for the evolution of mammals. Perhaps the most striking finding is the uniqueness of human placenta. The lower primates have non-invasive placentae and even tarsiers and New World monkeys show restricted trophoblast invasion. Moreover, a truly villous placenta occurs only in Old World monkeys and great apes. The two latter groups of haplorhine primates show varying degrees of trophoblast-uterine interaction, including differences in the extent of decidualization, formation and disintegration of a cytotrophoblastic shell, degree of interstitial trophoblast invasion and depth of trophoblast invasion into spiral arteries. Recently, the occurrence of human-like deep invasion was confirmed in gorillas and chimpanzees. As the still enigmatic disease of pre-eclampsia also occurs in these species, such information may reveal the evolutionary roots of this disease of impaired maternal-fetal interaction.},

@ARTICLE{Chaiworapongsa.ea2014:Pre-eclampsiapart1current,
  ABSTRACT = {Pre-eclampsia is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria at ≥20 weeks of gestation. In the absence of proteinuria, hypertension together with evidence of systemic disease (such as thrombocytopenia or elevated levels of liver transaminases) is required for diagnosis. This multisystemic disorder targets several organs, including the kidneys, liver and brain, and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Glomeruloendotheliosis is considered to be a characteristic lesion of pre-eclampsia, but can also occur in healthy pregnant women. The placenta has an essential role in development of this disorder. Pathogenetic mechanisms implicated in pre-eclampsia include defective deep placentation, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, autoantibodies to type-1 angiotensin II receptor, platelet and thrombin activation, intravascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and the presence of an antiangiogenic state, among which an imbalance of angiogenesis has emerged as one of the most important factors. However, this imbalance is not specific to pre-eclampsia, as it also occurs in intrauterine growth restriction, fetal death, spontaneous preterm labour and maternal floor infarction (massive perivillous fibrin deposition). The severity and timing of the angiogenic imbalance, together with maternal susceptibility, might determine the clinical presentation of pre-eclampsia. This Review discusses the diagnosis, classification, clinical manifestations and putative pathogenetic mechanisms of pre-eclampsia.},

@ARTICLE{Aarli.ea1997:Suppressiveeffectonlymphoproliferation,
  ABSTRACT = {PROBLEM: Syncytiotrophoblast microvillous plasma membranes (StMPM) are potent suppressors of lymphoproliferation in vitro. We have previously shown that soluble annexin II (AII) is present at higher levels in retroplacental serum (RPS) than in peripheral serum, and that soluble AII has an immunosuppressive effect. The aims of this study were to determine whether AII can be released from StMPM and whether soluble AII from StMPM exerts any immunosuppressive effect. METHOD OF STUDY: Isolated StMPM were incubated in growth medium for 18 hr and supernatants were prepared by ultracentrifugation. Soluble AII was detected by immunoblotting. StMPM, StMPM supernatant, and affinity-purified AII were analysed in a lymphoproliferation assay for immunomodulating activity. RESULTS: AII heavy chain and its p11 light chain were detected both in StMPM supernatant and in RPS after removal of StMPM particles by ultracentrifugation. StMPM, StMPM supernatant, and purified AII suppressed lymphoproliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Absorption of AII from StMPM supernatant reduced the suppressive activity. The suppressive effect of StMPM supernatant and purified AII was completely reversed by heating at 100 degrees C for 30 min or by adding recombinant interleukin-2 at 100 units/ml. Although StMPM and affinity-purified AII suppressed the proliferation of lymphocytes from all donors tested, StMPM supernatant suppressed the proliferation of lymphocytes from 12 of 23 donors. Six of eight female non-suppressed donors were multiparae, whereas five of five female suppressed donors were nulliparae. CONCLUSIONS: Annexin II is released by isolated placental membranes in vitro and is present in RPS, indicating in vivo release of AII at the fetomaternal interface, probably as AII heterotetramer. AII has immunosuppressive activity and may be important in fetal allograft survival.},

@ARTICLE{Mess.ea2006:Evolutionarytransformationsoffetal,
  ABSTRACT = {Analysis of molecular data sets has provided new insights into higher-level relationships of living Eutheria, including the recognition of Afrotheria as a novel taxon. This offers an opportunity to take a fresh look at the evolution of organ systems, including some that are little used in traditional systematics. In the present study, we attempted a reconstruction of the evolution of characters associated with placentation, the fetal membranes and the female reproductive tract. The evolutionary history of 21 characters has been traced, based on a current hypothesis of eutherian relationships, by applying the computer program MacClade. Accordingly, the analysis provides a first comprehensive interpretation of the stem species pattern of Eutheria. Of particular note, this pattern includes an endotheliochorial chorioallantoic placenta. The reconstructed pattern of Eutheria does not change in the basal nodes of the group. Thus, no character transformations occur on the stem lineages of Laurasiatheria or Euarchontoglires, and even Afrotheria has mostly plesiomorphic character conditions. However, two character transformations occur on the common stem lineage of Afrotheria and its sister taxon Xenarthra, i.e., amniogenesis by cavitation instead of folding and the precocial state of the newborn. In addition, we recognized one character transformation on the stem lineage of Afrotheria, i.e., the occurrence of a four-lobed allantoic sac. Thus, contrary to previous assertions, it is possible to identify morphological characters that could be synapomorphic for this novel taxon.},

@ARTICLE{Carmeille.ea2015:Annexin-A5promotesmembraneresealing,
  ABSTRACT = {Annexin-A5 (AnxA5) is the smallest member of the annexins, a group of soluble proteins that bind to membranes containing negatively-charged phospholipids, principally phosphatidylserine, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. AnxA5 presents unique properties of binding and self-assembling on membrane surfaces, forming highly ordered two-dimensional (2D) arrays. We showed previously that AnxA5 plays a central role in the machinery of cell membrane repair of murine perivascular cells, promoting the resealing of membrane damages via the formation of 2D protein arrays at membrane disrupted sites and preventing the extension of membrane ruptures. As the placenta is one of the richest source of AnxA5 in humans, we investigated whether AnxA5 was involved in membrane repair in this organ. We addressed this question at the level of human trophoblasts, either mononucleated cytotrophoblasts or multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts, in choriocarcinoma cells and primary trophoblasts. Using established procedure of laser irradiation and fluorescence microscopy, we observed that both human cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts repair efficiently a μm²-size disruption. Compared to wild-type cells, AnxA5-deficient trophoblasts exhibit severe defect of membrane repair. Through specifically binding to the disrupted site as early as a few seconds after membrane wounding, AnxA5 promotes membrane resealing of injured human trophoblasts. In addition, we observed that a large membrane area containing the disrupted site was released in the extracellular milieu. We propose mechanisms ensuring membrane resealing and subsequent lesion removal in human trophoblasts. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.},

@ARTICLE{Poeter.ea2013:DisruptionofannexinA1S100A11,
  ABSTRACT = {Endocytosis of activated growth factor receptors regulates spatio-temporal cellular signaling. In the case of the EGF receptor, sorting into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) controls signal termination and subsequently leads to receptor degradation in lysosomes. Annexin A1, a Ca(2+)-regulated membrane binding protein often deregulated in human cancers, interacts with the EGF receptor and is phosphorylated by internalized EGF receptor on endosomes. Most relevant for EGF receptor signal termination, annexin A1 is required for the formation of internal vesicles in MVBs that sequester ligand-bound EGF receptor away from the limiting membrane. To elucidate the mechanism underlying annexin A1-dependent EGF receptor trafficking we employed an N-terminally truncated annexin A1 mutant that lacks the EGF receptor phosphorylation site and the site for interaction with its protein ligand S100A11. Overexpression of this dominant-negative mutant induces a delay in EGF-induced EGF receptor transport to the LAMP1-positive late endosomal/lysosomal compartment and impairs ligand-induced EGF receptor degradation. Consistent with these findings, EGF-stimulated EGF receptor and MAP kinase pathway signaling is prolonged. Importantly, depletion of S100A11 also results in a delayed EGF receptor transport and prolonged MAP kinase signaling comparable to the trafficking defect observed in cells expressing the N-terminally truncated annexin A1 mutant. These results strongly suggest that the function of annexin A1 as a regulator of EGF receptor trafficking, degradation and signaling is critically mediated through an N-terminal interaction with S100A11 in the endosomal compartment. This interaction appears to be essential for lysosomal targeting of the EGF receptor, possibly by providing a physical scaffold supporting inward vesiculation in MVBs.

@ARTICLE{Armant.ea2015:Reducedexpressionofepidermal,
  ABSTRACT = {INTRODUCTION: The epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling system regulates trophoblast differentiation, and its disruption could contribute to perinatal disease. We hypothesized that this pathway is altered in preeclampsia, a disorder associated with trophoblast apoptosis and failure to invade and remodel the uterine spiral arteries. METHODS: Six EGF family peptides and a truncated EGF receptor splice variant (p110/EGFR) were examined using immunohistochemistry in the trophoblast of placentas (N = 76) from women with preeclampsia, and compared to placentas from women of similar gestational age (GA) with preterm labor (PTL) or small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses, as well as normal term placentas. EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGFA), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) were evaluated using ELISA in maternal plasma from another 20 pregnancies with or without preeclampsia. Cell death was evaluated in the HTR-8/SVneo human cytotrophoblast cell line using TUNEL to evaluate the protective effects of EGF peptides. RESULTS: Trophoblast HBEGF, TGFA, and EGF were significantly reduced in preeclampsia compared to PTL and SGA, while p110/EGFR accumulated significantly on the surface of the chorionic villi (p < 0.05). Plasma EGF levels were significantly decreased in preeclamptic patients, compared to non-preeclamptic patients (p < 0.05). HBEGF, EGF, TGFA, epiregulin, and betacellulin each blocked cytotrophoblast cell death in vitro (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Three members of the EGF family are dysregulated in placentas with preeclampsia, whereas p110/EGFR, a potential EGF receptor antagonist, is overexpressed. These findings are consistent with the concept that disruption of the EGF signaling system contributes to aberrant trophoblast development associated with preeclampsia.},

@ARTICLE{Matsumoto.ea2016:CD9suppresseshumanextravillous,
  ABSTRACT = {: During human placentation, the extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invades the maternal decidua and reconstructs maternal spiral arteries. However, the precise mechanisms that control EVT behavior have not yet been elucidated in detail. CD9 has been reported to be a cell-motility-related molecule. Since we previously observed that CD9 was expressed on human EVT, we examined the possible involvement of CD9 in the invasion process of EVT. Placental and umbilical samples were obtained from patients who underwent legal abortions, normal delivery, or hysterectomy. The expression of CD9 at the implantation site and on isolated EVT from a villous explant culture, an EVT-derived immortalized cell line, Swan71, and HUVEC was examined by immunocytochemical staining, flow cytometry, and RT-PCR. The effects of anti-CD9 functional antibody (ALB6) on EVT and Swan71 cell invasion were further examined by matrigel invasion assay along with shRNAmir gene knockdown treatment. CD9 was highly expressed on EVT at the boundary region of EVT invasion and intravascular EVT. EVT and Swan71 cell invasions were promoted by ALB6 or shRNAmir treatment. CD9 expression on Swan71 cells was reduced under hypo-oxygenic conditions, while its expression was increased by the co-culture with HUVEC. These findings suggest that CD9 could attenuate EVT invasion under the influence of an oxygen environment and maternal endothelial cells, proposing that CD9 is a potential regulator of human placental formation.},
