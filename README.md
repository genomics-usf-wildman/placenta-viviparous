Placenta Viviparous Paper
-------------------------

This repository contains all of the code necessary to generate the
analyses presented in this paper, including the manuscript itself.

Subdirectories
--------------

* data -- basic analyses and combining of aligned/called sequences
* fastq -- fastq files and makefiles to assemble, align, call, and
  annotate all of the sequences in all of the species examined
* manuscript -- R and LaTeX code to produce the published manuscript
* figures -- various complicated figures which are produced separately
  from the manuscript
* alignments -- alignments of genomic regions of interest in species
  studied with known genomes
* promoters -- promoter peak data for placenta samples in humans


Precomputed Data (Missing Supplemental Material)
------------------------------------------------

* [all_species_mean_fpkm.txt.xz](https://www.donarmstrong.com/ld/pv2016/all_species_mean_fpkm.txt.xz) contains
  all of the mean FPKM for each species. This was supposed to be
  included in the supplemental material of the paper, but was missing
  for some reason.
* [all_species_per_sample_fpkm.txt.xz](https://www.donarmstrong.com/ld/pv2016/all_species_per_sample_fpkm.txt.xz) contains
  the FPKM per sample across all samples in each species. This file
  was also missing from supplemental material for some reason.
