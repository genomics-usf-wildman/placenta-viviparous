  ABSTRACT     = {The traditional way to study the immunology of pregnancy follows the classical transplantation model, which views the fetus as an allograft. A more recent approach, which is the subject of this Review, focuses on the unique, local uterine immune response to the implanting placenta. This approach requires knowledge of placental structure and its variations in different species, as this greatly affects the type of immune response that is generated by the mother. At the implantation site, cells from the mother and the fetus intermingle during pregnancy. Unravelling what happens here is crucial to our understanding of why some human pregnancies are successful whereas others are not.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The mammalian placenta exhibits striking interspecific morphological variation, yet the implications of such diversity for reproductive strategies and fetal development remain obscure. More invasive hemochorial placentas, in which fetal tissues directly contact the maternal blood supply, are believed to facilitate nutrient transfer, resulting in higher fetal growth rates, and to be a state of relative fetal advantage in the evolution of maternal-offspring conflict. The extent of interdigitation between maternal and fetal tissues has received less attention than invasiveness but is also potentially important because it influences the surface area for exchange. We show that although increased placental invasiveness and interdigitation are both associated with shorter gestations, interdigitation is the key variable. Gestation times associated with highly interdigitated labyrinthine placentas are 44\% of those associated with less interdigitated villous and trabecular placentas. There is, however, no relationship between placental traits and neonatal body and brain size. Hence, species with more interdigitated placentas produce neonates of similar body and brain size but in less than half the time. We suggest that the effects of placental interdigitation on growth rates and the way that these are traded off against gestation length may be promising avenues for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of parent-offspring conflict.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The pregastrula stage mammalian conceptus consists of both embryonic and non-embryonic components. The latter forms the bulk of the tissues, provides nutrition for the developing embryo and also contributes developmental signals that influence events within the embryo itself. Understanding the origins and relationships between the embryonic and extraembryonic cell lineages is thus central to understanding development in mammals. Despite the apparent gross differences in early developmental strategy and form, the conceptuses of eutherian, marsupial and monotreme mammals show some remarkable similarities in the lineage allocation to trophoblast and hypoblast and in the emergent properties of the two cell types. We suggest that the gross differences can be explained by two relatively small evolutionary timing changes affecting cell adhesion patterns and the polarisation of developmentally significant information. These changes result in the conversion of a unilaminar blastocyst to a morula form composed of blastomeres with increased regulatory capacity.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The placenta is the most varied organ within the Mammalia. There are many similarities, as well as some differences, between the marsupial embryo and those of eutherian mammals. The most striking difference is the lack of the inner cell mass in the blastocyst which consists solely of a single layer of trophoblast cells. The trophoblast expands and eventually becomes part of the definitive chorio-vitelline placenta. The degree of functional differentiation between the vascular and non-vascular parts of the yolk sac placenta differs between species in the relative surface area that is attached to the endometrium, in trophoblast thickness, in yolk sac fusion with the luminal epithelium and most markedly in the degree of invasiveness. In marsupials, placental physiology has been best studied in the tammar wallaby. Despite the lack of invasion in the tammar, there is nevertheless maternal recognition of pregnancy in response to trophoblast formation. Contrary to popular opinion, the tammar placenta also elaborates hormones: at term it secretes prostaglandin F2alpha and accumulates cortisol, and it expresses genes for hormones such as growth hormone, IGF2 and relaxin. As in eutherian mammals, genomic imprinting is important for placental function. Despite the relatively short period of placentation, it is clear that the trophoblast and the placenta it forms are as important for successful pregnancy in marsupial as in eutherian mammals. Marsupials are certainly placental mammals. However marsupials have an additional trick in their pouches, with the physiologically sophisticated and extended lactation that has allowed them to exchange the umbilical cord for the teat.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The eutherian placenta is remarkable for its structural and functional variability. In order to construct and test comparative hypotheses relating ecological, behavioral and physiological traits to placental characteristics it is first necessary to reconstruct the historical course of placental evolution. Previous attempts to do so have yielded inconsistent results, particularly with respect to the early evolution of structural relationships between fetal and maternal circulatory systems. Here, we bring a battery of phylogenetic methods - including parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian approaches - to bear on the question of placental evolution. All of these approaches are consistent in indicating that highly invasive hemochorial placentation, as found in human beings and numerous other taxa, was an early evolutionary innovation present in the most ancient ancestors of the living placental mammals.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The placenta is essential for the success of therian mammalian reproduction. Intense selective pressure has shaped changes in placental anatomy and function during mammalian cladogenesis. Here we challenge the view that the hemochorial placenta is a derived feature in haplorhine primates. Using phylogenetic and statistical analyses of molecular and morphological data, we demonstrate that the ancestral eutherian mammalian placenta had the distinctive features of (i) hemochorial placental interface, (ii) a discoid shape, and (iii) a labyrinthine maternofetal interdigitation. These results reveal that the first eutherians had a deeply invasive placenta and imply that the major role of the placenta in sustaining pregnancy and promoting gestational development existed throughout the eutherian lineage that descended to humans from the last common ancestor of placental mammals. The ancestral state reconstructions demonstrate both clade-specific patterns of placentation and specific cases of convergent evolution within individual eutherian clades. Determining the mammalian pattern of change in placental morphology is important for understanding the evolutionary pressures faced by these lineages. The effects of selection pressures on the efficiency of placentation may stem from changes in nutritional demand, gestational length, number of embryos per pregnancy, uterine shape, and maternal body constitution. The influence of these factors on placental development needs further investigation.},

@ARTICLE{Carter2012:Evolutionofplacentalfunction,
  ABSTRACT     = {Placenta has a wide range of functions. Some are supported by novel genes that have evolved following gene duplication events while others require acquisition of gene expression by the trophoblast. Although not expressed in the placenta, high-affinity fetal hemoglobins play a key role in placental gas exchange. They evolved following duplications within the beta-globin gene family with convergent evolution occurring in ruminants and primates. In primates there was also an interesting rearrangement of a cassette of genes in relation to an upstream locus control region. Substrate transfer from mother to fetus is maintained by expression of classic sugar and amino acid transporters at the trophoblast microvillous and basal membranes. In contrast, placental peptide hormones have arisen largely by gene duplication, yielding for example chorionic gonadotropins from the luteinizing hormone gene and placental lactogens from the growth hormone and prolactin genes. There has been a remarkable degree of convergent evolution with placental lactogens emerging separately in the ruminant, rodent, and primate lineages and chorionic gonadotropins evolving separately in equids and higher primates. Finally, coevolution in the primate lineage of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors and human leukocyte antigens can be linked to the deep invasion of the uterus by trophoblast that is a characteristic feature of human placentation.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The chorioallantoic placenta connects mother and fetus in eutherian pregnancies. In order to understand the evolution of the placenta and provide further understanding of placenta biology, we sequenced the transcriptome of a term placenta of an African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and compared these data with RNA sequence and microarray data from other eutherian placentas including human, mouse, and cow. We characterized the composition of 55,910 expressed sequence tag (i.e., cDNA) contigs using our custom annotation pipeline. A Markov algorithm was used to cluster orthologs of human, mouse, cow, and elephant placenta transcripts. We found 2,963 genes are commonly expressed in the placentas of these eutherian mammals. Gene ontology categories previously suggested to be important for placenta function (e.g., estrogen receptor signaling pathway, cell motion and migration, and adherens junctions) were significantly enriched in these eutherian placenta-expressed genes. Genes duplicated in different lineages and also specifically expressed in the placenta contribute to the great diversity observed in mammalian placenta anatomy. We identified 1,365 human lineage-specific, 1,235 mouse lineage-specific, 436 cow lineage-specific, and 904 elephant-specific placenta-expressed (PE) genes. The most enriched clusters of human-specific PE genes are signal/glycoprotein and immunoglobulin, and humans possess a deeply invasive human hemochorial placenta that comes into direct contact with maternal immune cells. Inference of phylogenetically conserved and derived transcripts demonstrates the power of comparative transcriptomics to trace placenta evolution and variation across mammals and identified candidate genes that may be important in the normal function of the human placenta, and their dysfunction may be related to human pregnancy complications.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The invention of the placenta facilitated the evolution of mammals. How the placenta evolved from the simple structure observed in birds and reptiles into the complex organ that sustains human life is one of the great mysteries of evolution. By using a timecourse microarray analysis including the entire lifetime of the placenta, we uncover molecular and genomic changes that underlie placentation and find that two distinct evolutionary mechanisms were utilized during placental evolution in mice and human. Ancient genes involved in growth and metabolism were co-opted for use during early embryogenesis, likely enabling the accelerated development of extraembryonic tissues. Recently duplicated genes are utilized at later stages of placentation to meet the metabolic needs of a diverse range of pregnancy physiologies. Together, these mechanisms served to develop the specialized placenta, a novel structure that led to expansion of the eutherian mammal, including humankind.},

Specifically, we profiled gene expression from 91 human and mouse samples across a diverse array of tissues, organs, and cell lines. Because these samples predominantly come from the normal physiological state in the human and mouse, this dataset represents a preliminary, but substantial, description of the normal mammalian transcriptome. We have used this dataset to illustrate methods of mining these data, and to reveal insights into molecular and physiological gene function, mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, disease etiology, and comparative genomics. Finally, to allow the scientific community to use this resource, we have built a free and publicly accessible website (http://expression.gnf.org) that integrates data visualization and curation of current gene annotations.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) constitute a large family of recently duplicated genes. They show structural resemblance to pepsin and related aspartic proteinases. A total of 21 bovine (bo) PAG and 9 ovine (ov) PAG cDNA have been identified. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PAG are divided into two main groupings that accurately reflect their tissue expression, as determined by in situ hybridization. In the first pattern, represented by ovPAG-2 and boPAG-2, -8, -10, and -11 (where the numbering is arbitrary and reflects order of discovery within species), expression occurred throughout the outer epithelial layer of the placenta (trophectoderm). The second pattern was predominant localization to binucleate cells. Ribonuclease protection assays, which allow discrimination between closely related transcripts, have shown that the expression of PAG varies in a temporal manner over pregnancy. Of those bovine PAG expressed predominantly in binucleate cells, boPAG-1, -6, and -7 are expressed weakly, if at all, by Day 25 placenta, but are present at the middle and end of pregnancy. Others, such as boPAG-4, -5, and -9, are expressed at Day 25 and at earlier stages. Although not among the earliest PAG produced by the trophoblast, boPAG-1 has been used for pregnancy diagnosis, particularly in dairy cows, where there is a major need for a sensitive method capable of detecting pregnancy within 1 mo of conception. It seems likely that some of the newly discovered PAG will be better candidates than PAG-1 for pregnancy diagnosis.},

@ARTICLE{Simmons.ea2008:Spatialandtemporalexpression,
  ABSTRACT     = {BACKGROUND: The Prolactin (PRL) hormone gene family shows considerable variation among placental mammals. Whereas there is a single PRL gene in humans that is expressed by the pituitary, there are an additional 22 genes in mice including the placental lactogens (PL) and Prolactin-related proteins (PLPs) whose expression is limited to the placenta. To understand the regulation and potential functions of these genes, we conducted a detailed temporal and spatial expression study in the placenta between embryonic days 7.5 and E18.5 in three genetic strains. RESULTS: Of the 22 PRL/PL genes examined, only minor differences were observed among strains of mice. We found that not one family member has the same expression pattern as another when both temporal and spatial data were examined. There was also no correlation in expression between genes that were most closely related or between adjacent genes in the PRL/PL locus. Bioinformatic analysis of upstream regulatory regions identified conserved combinations (modules) of putative transcription factor binding sites shared by genes expressed in the same trophoblast subtype, supporting the notion that local regulatory elements, rather than locus control regions, specify subtype-specific expression. Further diversification in expression was also detected as splice variants for several genes. CONCLUSION: In the present study, a detailed temporal and spatial placental expression map was generated for all murine PRL/PL family members from E7.5 to E18.5 of gestation in three genetic strains. This detailed analysis uncovered several new markers for some trophoblast cell types that will be useful for future analysis of placental structure in mutant mice with placental phenotypes. More importantly, several main conclusions about regulation of the locus are apparent. First, no two family members have the same expression pattern when both temporal and spatial data are examined. Second, most genes are expressed in multiple trophoblast cell subtypes though none were detected in the chorion, where trophoblast stem cells reside, or in syncytiotrophoblast of the labyrinth layer. Third, bioinformatic comparisons of upstream regulatory regions identified predicted transcription factor binding site modules that are shared by genes expressed in the same trophoblast subtype. Fourth, further diversification of gene products from the PRL/PL locus occurs through alternative splice isoforms for several genes.},

This review summarizes their evolution, regulation, and biochemical functions and discusses their significance for placental development and function. Strikingly, the number of unique, truly placenta-specific genes that have been discovered to date is very small. The vast majority of placenta-specific gene products have resulted from one of three mechanisms: evolution of placenta-specific promoters, evolution of large gene families with several placenta-specific members, or adoption of functions associated with endogenous retroviruses and retroelements. Interestingly, nearly all the examples of placenta-specific genes that have been discovered to date are not present in all placental mammals.},

  ABSTRACT     = {CD33-related-Siglecs are lectins on immune cells that recognize sialic acids via extracellular domains, and deliver negative signals via cytosolic tyrosine-based regulatory motifs. We report that while Siglec-6/OB-BP1 (which can also bind leptin) is expressed on immune cells of both humans and the closely related great apes, placental trophoblast expression is human-specific, with little or no expression in ape placentae. Human-specific transcription factor recognition site changes in the Siglec-6 promoter region can help explain the human-specific expression. Human placenta also expresses natural ligands for Siglec-6 (a mixture of glycoproteins carrying cognate sialylated targets), in areas adjacent to Siglec-6 expression. Ligands were also found in uterine endometrium and on cell lines of trophoblastic or endometrial origin. Thus, Siglec-6 was recruited to placental expression during human evolution, presumably to interact with sialylated ligands for specific negative signaling functions and/or to regulate leptin availability. The control of human labor is poorly understood, but involves multiple cues, including placental signaling. Human birthing is also prolonged in comparison to that in our closest evolutionary relatives, the great apes. We found that Siglec-6 levels are generally low in placentae from elective surgical deliveries without known labor and the highest following completion of labor. We therefore speculate that the negative signaling potential of Siglec-6 was recruited to human-specific placental expression, to slow the tempo of the human birth process. The leptin-binding ability of Siglec-6 is also consistent with this hypothesis, as leptin-deficient mice have increased parturition times.},

@ARTICLE{Haig1993:Geneticconflictsinhuman,
  ABSTRACT     = {Pregnancy has commonly been viewed as a cooperative interaction between a mother and her fetus. The effects of natural selection on genes expressed in fetuses, however, may be opposed by the effects of natural selection on genes expressed in mothers. In this sense, a genetic conflict can be said to exist between maternal and fetal genes. Fetal genes will be selected to increase the transfer of nutrients to their fetus, and maternal genes will be selected to limit transfers in excess of some maternal optimum. Thus a process of evolutionary escalation is predicted in which fetal actions are opposed by maternal countermeasures. The phenomenon of genomic imprinting means that a similar conflict exists within fetal cells between genes that are expressed when maternally derived, and genes that are expressed when paternally derived. During implantation, fetally derived cells (trophoblast) invade the maternal endometrium and remodel the endometrial spiral arteries into low-resistance vessels that are unable to constrict. This invasion has three consequences. First, the fetus gains direct access to its mother's arterial blood. Therefore, a mother cannot reduce the nutrient content of blood reaching the placenta without reducing the nutrient supply to her own tissues. Second, the volume of blood reaching the placenta becomes largely independent of control by the local maternal vasculature. Third, the placenta is able to release hormones and other substances directly into the maternal circulation. Placental hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human placental lactogen (hPL), are predicted to manipulate maternal physiology for fetal benefit. For example, hPL is proposed to act on maternal prolactin receptors to increase maternal resistance to insulin. If unopposed, the effect of hPL would be to maintain higher blood glucose levels for longer periods after meals. This action, however, is countered by increased maternal production of insulin. Gestational diabetes develops if the mother is unable to mount an adequate response to fetal manipulation. Similarly, fetal genes are predicted to enhance the flow of maternal blood through the placenta by increasing maternal blood pressure. Preeclampsia can be interpreted as an attempt by a poorly nourished fetus to increase its supply of nutrients by increasing the resistance of its mother's peripheral circulation.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Preeclampsia is a major cause of perinatal mortality and disease affecting 5-10\% of all pregnancies worldwide, but its etiology remains poorly understood despite considerable research effort. Parent-offspring conflict theory suggests that such hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may have evolved through the ability of fetal genes to increase maternal blood pressure as this enhances general nutrient supply. However, such mechanisms for inducing hypertension in pregnancy would need to incur sufficient offspring health benefits to compensate for the obvious risks for maternal and fetal health towards the end of pregnancy in order to explain why these disorders have not been removed by natural selection in our hunter-gatherer ancestors. We analyzed >750,000 live births in the Danish National Patient Registry and all registered medical diagnoses for up to 30 years after birth. We show that offspring exposed to pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in trimester 1 had significantly reduced overall later-life disease risks, but increased risks when PIH exposure started or developed as preeclampsia in later trimesters. Similar patterns were found for first-year mortality. These results suggest that early PIH leading to improved postpartum survival and health represents a balanced compromise between the reproductive interests of parents and offspring, whereas later onset of PIH may reflect an unbalanced parent-offspring conflict at the detriment of maternal and offspring health.},

@ARTICLE{Carter.ea2011:Evolutionofinvasiveplacentation,
  ABSTRACT     = {It is now possible to view human placentation in an evolutionary context because advances in molecular phylogenetics provide a reliable scenario for the evolution of mammals. Perhaps the most striking finding is the uniqueness of human placenta. The lower primates have non-invasive placentae and even tarsiers and New World monkeys show restricted trophoblast invasion. Moreover, a truly villous placenta occurs only in Old World monkeys and great apes. The two latter groups of haplorhine primates show varying degrees of trophoblast-uterine interaction, including differences in the extent of decidualization, formation and disintegration of a cytotrophoblastic shell, degree of interstitial trophoblast invasion and depth of trophoblast invasion into spiral arteries. Recently, the occurrence of human-like deep invasion was confirmed in gorillas and chimpanzees. As the still enigmatic disease of pre-eclampsia also occurs in these species, such information may reveal the evolutionary roots of this disease of impaired maternal-fetal interaction.},

@ARTICLE{Chaiworapongsa.ea2014:Pre-eclampsiapart1current,
  ABSTRACT     = {Pre-eclampsia is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria at ≥20 weeks of gestation. In the absence of proteinuria, hypertension together with evidence of systemic disease (such as thrombocytopenia or elevated levels of liver transaminases) is required for diagnosis. This multisystemic disorder targets several organs, including the kidneys, liver and brain, and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Glomeruloendotheliosis is considered to be a characteristic lesion of pre-eclampsia, but can also occur in healthy pregnant women. The placenta has an essential role in development of this disorder. Pathogenetic mechanisms implicated in pre-eclampsia include defective deep placentation, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, autoantibodies to type-1 angiotensin II receptor, platelet and thrombin activation, intravascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and the presence of an antiangiogenic state, among which an imbalance of angiogenesis has emerged as one of the most important factors. However, this imbalance is not specific to pre-eclampsia, as it also occurs in intrauterine growth restriction, fetal death, spontaneous preterm labour and maternal floor infarction (massive perivillous fibrin deposition). The severity and timing of the angiogenic imbalance, together with maternal susceptibility, might determine the clinical presentation of pre-eclampsia. This Review discusses the diagnosis, classification, clinical manifestations and putative pathogenetic mechanisms of pre-eclampsia.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Changes in gene expression are thought to underlie many of the phenotypic differences between species. However, large-scale analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten species that represent all major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs, lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Many questions about the regulation, functional specialization, computational prediction, and evolution of genomic imprinting would be better addressed by having an exhaustive genome-wide catalog of genes that display parent-of-origin differential expression. As a first-pass scan for novel imprinted genes, we performed mRNA-seq experiments on embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) mouse placenta cDNA samples from reciprocal cross F1 progeny of AKR and PWD mouse strains and quantified the allele-specific expression and the degree of parent-of-origin allelic imbalance. We confirmed the imprinting status of 23 known imprinted genes in the placenta and found that 12 genes reported previously to be imprinted in other tissues are also imprinted in mouse placenta. Through a well-replicated design using an orthogonal allelic-expression technology, we verified 5 novel imprinted genes that were not previously known to be imprinted in mouse (Pde10, Phf17, Phactr2, Zfp64, and Htra3). Our data suggest that most of the strongly imprinted genes have already been identified, at least in the placenta, and that evidence supports perhaps 100 additional weakly imprinted genes. Despite previous appearance that the placenta tends to display an excess of maternally expressed imprinted genes, with the addition of our validated set of placenta-imprinted genes, this maternal bias has disappeared.},

@ARTICLE{Hughes.ea2015:Evaluatingintra-andinter-individual,
  ABSTRACT     = {BACKGROUND: Gene expression variation is a phenotypic trait of particular interest as it represents the initial link between genotype and other phenotypes. Analyzing how such variation apportions among and within groups allows for the evaluation of how genetic and environmental factors influence such traits. It also provides opportunities to identify genes and pathways that may have been influenced by non-neutral processes. Here we use a population genetics framework and next generation sequencing to evaluate how gene expression variation is apportioned among four human groups in a natural biological tissue, the placenta. RESULTS: We estimate that on average, 33.2\%, 58.9\%, and 7.8\% of the placental transcriptome is explained by variation within individuals, among individuals, and among human groups, respectively. Additionally, when technical and biological traits are included in models of gene expression they each account for roughly 2\% of total gene expression variation. Notably, the variation that is significantly different among groups is enriched in biological pathways associated with immune response, cell signaling, and metabolism. Many biological traits demonstrate correlated changes in expression in numerous pathways of potential interest to clinicians and evolutionary biologists. Finally, we estimate that the majority of the human placental transcriptome exhibits expression profiles consistent with neutrality; the remainder are consistent with stabilizing selection, directional selection, or diversifying selection. CONCLUSIONS: We apportion placental gene expression variation into individual, population, and biological trait factors and identify how each influence the transcriptome. Additionally, we advance methods to associate expression profiles with different forms of selection.},

@ARTICLE{Coleman.ea2010:Structuralannotationofequine,
  ABSTRACT     = {The horse, like the majority of animal species, has a limited amount of species-specific expressed sequence data available in public databases. As a result, structural models for the majority of genes defined in the equine genome are predictions based on ab initio sequence analysis or the projection of gene structures from other mammalian species. The current study used Illumina-based sequencing of messenger RNA (RNA-seq) to help refine structural annotation of equine protein-coding genes and for a preliminary assessment of gene expression patterns. Sequencing of mRNA from eight equine tissues generated 293,758105 sequence tags of 35 bases each, equalling 10.28 gbp of total sequence data. The tag alignments represent approximately 207 × coverage of the equine mRNA transcriptome and confirmed transcriptional activity for roughly 90\% of the protein-coding gene structures predicted by Ensembl and NCBI. Tag coverage was sufficient to refine the structural annotation for 11,356 of these predicted genes, while also identifying an additional 456 transcripts with exon/intron features that are not listed by either Ensembl or NCBI. Genomic locus data and intervals for the protein-coding genes predicted by the Ensembl and NCBI annotation pipelines were combined with 75,116 RNA-seq-derived transcriptional units to generate a consensus equine protein-coding gene set of 20,302 defined loci. Gene ontology annotation was used to compare the functional and structural categories of genes expressed in either a tissue-restricted pattern or broadly across all tissue samples.},

@ARTICLE{Ahanda.ea2012:Predictionofaltered3-,
  ABSTRACT     = {THE SLA (swine leukocyte antigen, MHC: SLA) genes are the most important determinants of immune, infectious disease and vaccine response in pigs; several genetic associations with immunity and swine production traits have been reported. However, most of the current knowledge on SLA is limited to gene coding regions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of a large number of protein-coding genes in metazoans, and are suggested to play important roles in fine-tuning immune mechanisms and disease responses. Polymorphisms in either miRNAs or their gene targets may have a significant impact on gene expression by abolishing, weakening or creating miRNA target sites, possibly leading to phenotypic variation. We explored the impact of variants in the 3'-UTR miRNA target sites of genes within the whole SLA region. The combined predictions by TargetScan, PACMIT and TargetSpy, based on different biological parameters, empowered the identification of miRNA target sites and the discovery of polymorphic miRNA target sites (poly-miRTSs). Predictions for three SLA genes characterized by a different range of sequence variation provided proof of principle for the analysis of poly-miRTSs from a total of 144 M RNA-Seq reads collected from different porcine tissues. Twenty-four novel SNPs were predicted to affect miRNA-binding sites in 19 genes of the SLA region. Seven of these genes (SLA-1, SLA-6, SLA-DQA, SLA-DQB1, SLA-DOA, SLA-DOB and TAP1) are linked to antigen processing and presentation functions, which is reminiscent of associations with disease traits reported for altered miRNA binding to MHC genes in humans. An inverse correlation in expression levels was demonstrated between miRNAs and co-expressed SLA targets by exploiting a published dataset (RNA-Seq and small RNA-Seq) of three porcine tissues. Our results support the resource value of RNA-Seq collections to identify SNPs that may lead to altered miRNA regulation patterns.},

@ARTICLE{Ernest2003:lifehistorycharacteristicsofplacental,
  ABSTRACT     = {The purpose of this data set was to compile general life history characteristics for a variety of mammalian species in order to perform comparative life history analyses among different taxa and different body size groups. Data were collected from the literature, and data sources are documented for each species within the data file. Since life history characteristics will show minor variation with environmental conditions (resource availability, climate, competitive environment, and predation pressure) a general life history for each species was sought to average over minor differences in local populations. To create a general life history for each species, life history values are often an average from several literature sources. Life history variables included in the data set are: maximum lifespan (months), age of first reproduction (months), gestation time (months), weaning age (months), weaning mass (grams), litter size, litters per year, newborn mass (grams), and adult body mass (grams). Since these data were collected with the intent to examine general life history patterns, they are good for examining large-scale patterns, specifically in comparing life history characteristics for different orders or families of mammals. All orders of placental mammals, except Chiroptera (bats) are represented in this data set: Artiodactyla (161 species), Carnivora (197 species), Cetacea (55 species), Dermoptera (2 species), Hydracoidea (4 species), Insectivora (91 species), Lagomorpha (42 species), Macroscelidea (10 species), Perissodactyla (15 species), Pholidota (7 species), Primates (156 species), Proboscidea (2 species), Rodentia (665 species), Scandentia (7 species), Sirenia (5 species), Tubulidentata (1 species), and Xenarthra (20 species). There are two caveats on this data set, however. First, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of life history parameters with specific environmental conditions is important. Second, while this data set is extensive, it is not exhaustive. The creation of an exhaustive data set is the ultimate goal, but that goal is still several years from completion. In the meantime, researchers utilizing the data set are urged to conduct their own search for data not reported within the current data set. Researchers are also encouraged to contact the author of the data set and alert her to literature sources containing data for missing variables or species.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Estrus, gestation, and placentation were studied in the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and the gray short-tailed oppossum (Monodelphis domestica), representatives of the prototypic, New World marsupial family Didelphidae. Didelphis is a large (3,000 g), pouched opossum that exhibits a 28-day estrous cycle, spontaneous estrus and ovulation, and a high ovulation rate (60 ova per cycle). Monodelphis is a small (100 g), pouchless opossum with male-induced estrus and ovulation and a moderate ovulation rate (12 ova per cycle). Implantation occurs on day 10 of the 13-day gestation period in Didelphis and on day 12 of the 15-day gestation in Monodelphis. Gestation and placentation, including the ultrastructural features of trophoblastic apposition to the uterine mucosa, are very similar in Didelphis and Monodelphis. Differences, such as a larger increase in uterine volume and a more highly folded endometrium following implantation in Monodelphis are minor. They appear to be related to the smaller maternal body size and the relatively larger uterine load of embryos in Monodelphis. Because body size is one of the major variables among New World marsupials, the descriptions of gestation and placentation presented here for Didelphis and Monodelphis, provide a basis for comparison in future studies of didelphid marsupials.},

  ABSTRACT     = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.},

  ABSTRACT     = {High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed >430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

@ARTICLE{Trapnell.ea2009:TopHatdiscoveringsplicejunctions,
  ABSTRACT     = {MOTIVATION: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites. RESULTS: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.

Although they are similar in many respects, bonobos and chimpanzees differ strikingly in key social and sexual behaviours, and for some of these traits they show more similarity with humans than with each other. Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome to study its evolutionary relationship with the chimpanzee and human genomes. We find that more than three per cent of the human genome is more closely related to either the bonobo or the chimpanzee genome than these are to each other. These regions allow various aspects of the ancestry of the two ape species to be reconstructed. In addition, many of the regions that overlap genes may eventually help us understand the genetic basis of phenotypes that humans share with one of the two apes to the exclusion of the other.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There- fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni- type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R.

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  ABSTRACT     = {INTRODUCTION: Follistatin-like-1 (FSTL1) is a widely expressed secreted protein with diverse but poorly understood functions. Originally described as a pro-inflammatory molecule, it has recently been reported to play a role in signaling pathways that regulate development and homeostasis. Distinctively, FSTL1 harbors within its 3'-UTR the sequence encoding microRNA-198 (miR-198), shown to be inversely regulated relative to FSTL1 expression and to exhibit opposite actions on cellular processes such as cell migration. We sought to investigate the expression of FSTL1 and to assess its interplay with miR-198 in human trophoblasts. METHODS: We used a combination of northern blot analyses, quantitative PCR, small RNA sequencing, western blot and immunohistochemistry to characterize FSTL1 and miR-198 expression in placental trophoblasts. We also used reporter assays to examine the post-transcriptional regulation of FSTL1 and assess its putative regulation by miR-198. RESULTS: We detected the expression of FSTL1 transcript in both the human extravillous trophoblast line HTR-8/SVneo and in primary term human villous trophoblasts. We also found that the expression of FSTL1 was largely restricted to extravillous trophoblasts. Hypoxia enhanced the expression of FSTL1 protein in cultured primary villous trophoblasts. Interestingly, we did not detect any evidence for expression or function of mature miR-198 in human trophoblasts. DISCUSSION: Our data indicate that placental FSTL1 is expressed particularly in extravillous trophoblasts. We also found no evidence for placental expression of miR-198, or for its regulation of FSTL1, implying that the post-transcriptional regulation of FSTL1 by miR-198 is tissue specific.},

@ARTICLE{Lei.ea1992:Cloningandexpressionof,
  ABSTRACT = {The pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) of the human placenta and the carcinoembryonic antigens comprise a subfamily within the immunoglobulin superfamily. There may be as many as 20 different PSG genes which are predominantly expressed in the placenta. As an initial step toward understanding the control of PSG expression, we isolated and characterized two nearly identical PSG genes, PSG1 and PSG1-I. PSG1, which lacks exon 1 (5'/L), but contains exons 2 (L/N), 3 (A1), 4 (A2), and 5 (B2-C), encodes five previously identified type I transcripts, PSG1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1e in a L/N-A1-A2-B2-C domain arrangement. PSG1-I, which contains a complete transcriptional unit consisting of exons 5'/L, L/N, A1, and B2-C, encodes type II PSG transcripts in a L/N-A1-B2-C domain arrangement. The predicted PSG1-I-encoded proteins share nearly complete sequence identity with the PSG1-encoded members, except the latter contain extra A domains. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction of placental or hydatidiform mole cDNA demonstrates that PSG1-I is a functional type II PSG gene. Using transient expression assays, we demonstrated that the -834/-34 region upstream of the translational start site of the PSG1-I gene contained the PSG promoter elements and the -834 to -456 region contained negative control elements. Sodium butyrate, an inducer of PSG synthesis, greatly stimulated expression of all PSG1-I-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene constructs. However, butyrate was at least 2-fold more effective in stimulating CAT activity of fusion genes containing upstream sequences (-834 to -576) than those containing proximal sequences (-456 to -172), suggesting two regions in the PSG1-I gene that mediate the butyrate response.},

@ARTICLE{Petsas.ea2012:Aberrantexpressionofcorticotropin-releasing,
  ABSTRACT     = {Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its receptors are expressed in human placenta. Recently, the impaired function of this system has been associated with a number of complications of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that CRH participates in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia through the induction of macrophage-mediated apoptosis of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). We found that the expression of CRH was increased in the EVT of the placental bed biopsy specimens from pre-eclamptic pregnancies (1.8-fold increase; P < 0.05). In addition, significantly larger numbers of apoptotic EVT were detected in pre-eclamptic placentas compared with normal ones (P < 0.05), and only in pre-eclamptic placentas, decidual macrophages were found to be Fas ligand (FasL)-positive. In vitro studies on the effect of CRH on human macrophages suggested that CRH induced the expression of the FasL protein in human macrophages and potentiated their ability to induce the apoptosis of a Fas-expressing EVT-based hybridoma cell line in co-cultures. These findings demonstrate a possible mechanism by which the aberrant expression of CRH in pre-eclampsia may activate the FasL-positive decidual macrophages, impair the physiological turnover of EVT and eventually disturb placentation.},

  ABSTRACT     = {CONTEXT: mRNA of placental origin in maternal blood shows potential as a clinical biomarker of obstetric diseases such as preeclampsia (PE). We hypothesized that mRNA transcripts very highly expressed in the placenta relative to other tissues will be differentially expressed in PE and be useful as mRNA biomarkers in maternal blood. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify a panel of genes highly expressed in the placenta and compare their expression in placenta and maternal whole blood from PE vs. control pregnancies. SETTING: Placental tissue and maternal whole blood specimens were obtained from normotensive controls (n = 15) and pregnancies complicated by severe preterm PE (n = 21). INTERVENTION: mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We identified 20 genes exhibiting highest to fourth highest expression in the placenta relative to all other tissues. All genes were detectable in placenta. Nine of the 20 genes were detectable in maternal whole blood. Four of the nine genes detectable in blood (i.e. PLAC3, PLAC4, CRH, and ERVWE1) were significantly increased in both maternal blood and placenta from PE pregnancies. The remaining five genes detectable in maternal blood were unchanged in both blood and placenta from PE pregnancies. Thus, there was complete correlation of gene expression between maternal blood and placenta. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating mRNA coding genes of high placental expression show strong correlation with transcript levels in preeclamptic placenta. Such transcripts may be promising candidates to screen as mRNA biomarkers of PE in maternal whole blood.},

  ABSTRACT     = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to look at differences in the placental tissue expression of KiSS-1 and REN genes from preeclamptic and healthy pregnant women, that could account for a possible synergistic function for both genes in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study involved 27 preeclamptic women and 27 normoevolutive pregnant women. cDNA was obtained from placental tissue to carry out qPCR for both KiSS-1 and REN genes in order to compare mRNA expression levels in the studied groups. Statistical analysis showed expression differences that correlate with clinical and/or biochemical variables. RESULTS: Higher expression for KiSS-1 in PEE vs. control woman (p=0.001) was observed, whereas no difference was observed for REN expression (p=0.300) when all the subjects were included. However, REN expression was significant higher when the samples were stratified according to preeclampsia severity. For 18 mild preeclamptic patients the p-value was p=0.001 compared to their controls, while for the remaining nine with severe preeclampsia the expression became significant (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the high KiSS-1 expression seen in preeclamptic patients is in accordance with its role as an inhibitor of trophoblast invasiveness and maintained until the end of gestation. On the other hand, aggressive therapeutic management and/or severity status of patients have a direct effect on placental REN expression levels, masking the natural high expression of this gene on preeclamptic placental tissue. Therefore it was not possible to establish a real concordant expression profile for KiSS-1 and REN genes.},

METHODS: ADAM12s was measured by a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay developed by PerkinElmer Life Science. Maternal serum samples from women taking part in early first-trimester aneuploidy screening in whom the pregnancy resulted in pre-eclampsia (64) were identified from a cohort of 4,390 singleton pregnancies in which uterine artery Doppler mean Pulsatility Index (PI) had been measured at 22-24 weeks. From amongst those cases delivering a normal term infant with birth weight greater than the 10th centile for gestational age 240 cases were selected as gestational age-matched controls. A second study group consisting of maternal serum taken at 22-24 weeks at the time of uterine artery Doppler in a group of 12 women developing pre-eclampsia were compared with 86 matched controls from a previously studied cohort of 24 cases and 144 controls. Serum ADAM12s concentrations were converted to multiple of the median (MoM) to take account of gestational age variation. RESULTS: First-trimester maternal serum ADAM12s levels in women who developed pre-eclampsia were reduced with a median MoM of 0.71 which was further reduced in those delivering prior to 35 weeks (0.50). At the 5th centile of normal (0.48 MoM) ADAM12s identified 27\% of cases with pre-eclampsia and 47\% of those with early pre-eclampsia. Combining ADAM12s with PAPP-A from a previous study only resulted in a further 1\% increase in detection of all women developing pre-eclampsia. However combining ADAM12s with mean PI increased the detection rate to 66\%. In the second trimester at 22-24 weeks the maternal serum ADAM12s levels were increased in those women developing pre-eclampsia compared to controls (709 vs 486 ug/L, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: ADAM12s in addition to being a potential marker of aneuploidy may also be a marker of pre-eclampsia. Further studies are required to see if this can improve on the clinical discrimination already provided by PAPP-A in the early first trimester.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The gene PRG2, encoding the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP), is one of the most highly expressed genes during human pregnancy, and low proMBP levels predict Down syndrome and poor pregnancy outcome. Reminiscent of a magnet, the primary structure of proMBP is extremely charge polarized, consisting of an N-terminal acidic propiece followed by a highly basic MBP domain in the C-terminal. Many tissues synthesize and secrete full-length proMBP, but only distinct cell types of the immune system process and store mature MBP in intracellular granules. MBP is released upon degranulation of eosinophil leukocytes and is toxic to bacteria, parasites, and mammalian cells. In contrast, proMBP is apparently nontoxic and functions in the inhibition of proteolysis and prohormone conversion. Recent research has revealed the complexity of proMBP biology and shed light on the process of MBP generation. ProMBP specifically forms disulfide-mediated, covalent complexes with the metzincin metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA) and the prohormone angiotensinogen (AGT). In both processes, PAPPA and AGT have reduced biological activity in the resulting complexes. In addition, proMBP is a component of high-molecular-weight AGT and, therefore, is potentially involved in the development of preeclampsia and in pregnancy-induced hypertension.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Aberrant activation of the androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role during prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CR-PCa) after androgen deprivation therapy, the mainstay systemic treatment for PCa. New strategies to abrogate AR activity and biomarkers that predict aggressive tumor behavior are essential for improved therapeutic intervention. PCa tissue microarrays herein reveal that prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4), an X-linked cancer/testis antigen, is highly up-regulated in the epithelium of preneoplastic lesions compared with benign epithelium, but subsequently decreases with tumor progression. We show that AR signaling is attenuated in PAGE4-expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo, most likely via impaired androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation and subsequently reduced AR protein stabilization and phosphorylation at serines 81 and 213. Consistently, epithelial PAGE4 protein levels inversely correlated with AR activation status in hormone-naive and CR-PCa clinical specimens. Moreover, PAGE4 impaired the development of CR-PCa xenografts, and strong PAGE4 immunoreactivity independently predicted favorable patient survival in hormone-naive PCa. Collectively, these data suggest that dysregulation of epithelial PAGE4 modulates AR signaling, thereby promoting progression to advanced lethal PCa and highlight the potential value of PAGE4 as a prognostic and therapeutic target.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Annexin A2 (AnxA2) was originally identified as a substrate of the pp60v-src oncoprotein in transformed chicken embryonic fibroblasts. It is an abundant protein that associates with biological membranes as well as the actin cytoskeleton, and has been implicated in intracellular vesicle fusion, the organization of membrane domains, lipid rafts and membrane-cytoskeleton contacts. In addition to an intracellular role, AnxA2 has been reported to participate in processes localized to the cell surface including extracellular protease regulation and cell-cell interactions. There are many reports showing that AnxA2 is differentially expressed between normal and malignant tissue and potentially involved in tumour progression. An important aspect of AnxA2 function relates to its interaction with small Ca(2+) -dependent adaptor proteins called S100 proteins, which is the topic of this review. The interaction between AnxA2 and S100A10 has been very well characterized historically; more recently, other S100 proteins have been shown to interact with AnxA2 as well. The biochemical evidence for the occurrence of these protein interactions will be discussed, as well as their function. Recent studies aiming to generate inhibitors of S100 protein interactions will be described and the potential of these inhibitors to further our understanding of AnxA2 S100 protein interactions will be discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {MicroRNA targets are often recognized through pairing between the miRNA seed region and complementary sites within target mRNAs, but not all of these canonical sites are equally effective, and both computational and in vivo UV-crosslinking approaches suggest that many mRNAs are targeted through non-canonical interactions. Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.},

To elucidate the functions of evolutionarily conserved retrotransposon-derived genes in mammalian development, we produced mice that lack one of these genes, Peg10 (paternally expressed 10), which is a paternally expressed imprinted gene on mouse proximal chromosome 6. The Peg10 knockout mice showed early embryonic lethality owing to defects in the placenta. This indicates that Peg10 is critical for mouse parthenogenetic development and provides the first direct evidence of an essential role of an evolutionarily conserved retrotransposon-derived gene in mammalian development.},

@ARTICLE{Fahlbusch.ea2015:Trophoblastexpressiondynamicsof,
  ABSTRACT     = {Gastrokines (GKNs) were originally described as stomach-specific tumor suppressor genes. Recently, we identified GKN1 in extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) of human placenta. GKN1 treatment reduced the migration of the trophoblast cell line JEG-3. GKN2 is known to inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells and may interact with GKN1. Recently, GKN2 was detected in the placental yolk sac of mice. We therefore aimed to further characterize placental GKN2 expression. By immunohistochemistry, healthy first-trimester placenta showed ubiquitous staining for GKN2 at its early gestational stage. At later gestational stages, a more differentiated expression pattern in EVT and villous cytotrophoblasts became evident. In healthy third-trimester placenta, only EVT retained strong GKN2 immunoreactivity. In contrast, HELLP placentas showed a tendency of increased levels of GKN2 expression with a more prominent GKN2 staining in their syncytiotrophoblast. Choriocarcinoma cell lines did not express GKN2. Besides its trophoblastic expression, we found human GKN2 in fibrotic villi, in amniotic membrane and umbilical cord. GKN2 co-localized with smooth muscle actin in villous myofibroblasts and with HLA-G and GKN1 in EVT. In the rodent placenta, GKN2 was specifically located in the spongiotrophoblast layer. Thus, the gestational age-dependent and compartment-specific expression pattern of GKN2 points to a role for placental development. The syncytial expression of GKN2 in HELLP placentas might represent a reduced state of functional differentiation of the syncytiotrophoblast. Moreover, the specific GKN2 expression in the rodent spongiotrophoblast layer (equivalent to human EVT) might suggest an important role in EVT physiology.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Loss of TFAP2C in mouse leads to developmental defects in the extra-embryonic compartment with lethality at embryonic day (E)7.5. To investigate the requirement of TFAP2C in later placental development, deletion of TFAP2C was induced throughout extra-embryonic ectoderm at E6.5, leading to severe placental abnormalities caused by reduced trophoblast population and resulting in embryonic retardation by E8.5. Deletion of TFAP2C in TPBPA(+) progenitors at E8.5 results in growth arrest of the junctional zone. TFAP2C regulates its target genes Cdkn1a (previously p21) and Dusp6, which are involved in repression of MAPK signaling. Loss of TFAP2C reduces activation of ERK1/2 in the placenta. Downregulation of Akt1 and reduced activation of phosphorylated AKT in the mutant placenta are accompanied by impaired glycogen synthesis. Loss of TFAP2C led to upregulation of imprinted gene H19 and downregulation of Slc38a4 and Ascl2. The placental insufficiency post E16.5 causes fetal growth restriction, with 19\% lighter mutant pups. Knockdown of TFAP2C in human trophoblast choriocarcinoma JAr cells inhibited MAPK and AKT signaling. Thus, we present a model where TFAP2C in trophoblasts controls proliferation by repressing Cdkn1a and activating the MAPK pathway, further supporting differentiation of glycogen cells by activating the AKT pathway.},

@ARTICLE{Waller.ea1996:associationbetweenmaternalserum,
  ABSTRACT     = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) predict increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth (before 37 weeks), preterm birth occurring at or before 28 weeks, small for gestational age (SGA) infant, preeclampsia, and placental abnormalities, and to determine whether low levels of serum AFP predict increased or decreased risk of these outcomes. METHODS: Using the mother's first name, last name, and zip code, we linked the records of 51,008 women who participated in the California Alpha-Fetoprotein Screening Program between June 15, 1986, and October 31, 1987, with California birth certificates for singleton infants born in 1987. The accuracy of the data linkage was confirmed by manually examining complete names, mother's ethnicity, and mother's age for a sample of 500 of the mother-infant linkages. Blood samples were obtained at 15-19 weeks. RESULTS: A strong gradient of increasing risk of preterm birth with increasing levels of serum AFP was observed (test for trend, P < .01). Among women with high levels of serum AFP (at least 2.5 multiples of the median [MoM]), 24.3\% had preterm births, compared with 3.8\% of women with low levels of serum AFP (0.81 MoM or less), odds ratio 8.7, 95\% confidence interval 7.1-10.7). This gradient persisted when preterm infants of 28 weeks or less were examined separately. Similar gradients were observed for the risk of preeclampsia and placental abnormalities. There was a weaker U-shaped relation between serum AFP level and the risk of an SGA infant. CONCLUSION: Low levels of second-trimester maternal serum AFP are associated with a very low risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia, and placental complications. High levels of serum AFP are strongly associated with preterm birth, preeclampsia, and placental abnormalities. There is a modest association between AFP levels (both low and high) and SGA birth.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Mice that harbor a targeted homozygous defect in the gene coding for the gap junctional protein connexin26 died in utero during the transient phase from early to midgestation. From day 10 post coitum onwards, development of homozygous embryos was retarded, which led to death around day 11 post coitum. Except for growth retardation, no gross morphological alterations were detected between homozygous connexin26-defective embryos and wild-type littermates. At day 9 postcoitum, when chorioallantoic placenta started to function, connexin26 was weakly expressed in the yolk sac epithelium, between syncytiotrophoblasts I and II in the labyrinth region of the placenta, and in the skin of the embryo. At day 10 post coitum, expression of connexin26 in the placenta was much stronger than at the other locations. To analyze involvement of connexin26 in the placental transfer of nutrients, we have measured embryonic uptake of the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue 3-O-[14C]methylglucose, injected into the maternal tail vein. At day 10 post coitum, viable, homozygous connexin26-defective embryos accumulated only approximately 40\% of the radioactivity measured in wild-type and heterozygous littermates of the same size. We conclude that the uptake of glucose, and presumably other nutrients as well, from maternal blood into connexin26-deficient mouse embryos was severely impaired and apparently not sufficient to support the rapid organogenesis during midgestation. Our results suggest that connexin26 gap junction channels likely fulfill an essential role in the transfer of maternal nutrients and embryonic waste products between syncytiotrophoblast I and II in the labyrinth layer of the mouse placenta.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Galectin-1 is an anti-inflammatory lectin with pleiotropic regulatory functions at the crossroads of innate and adaptive immunity. It is expressed in immune privileged sites and is implicated in establishing maternal-fetal immune tolerance, which is essential for successful pregnancy in eutherian mammals. Here, we show conserved placental localization of galectin-1 in primates and its predominant expression in maternal decidua. Phylogenetic footprinting and shadowing unveil conserved cis motifs, including an estrogen responsive element in the 5' promoter of LGALS1, that were gained during the emergence of placental mammals and could account for sex steroid regulation of LGALS1 expression, thus providing additional evidence for the role of galectin-1 in immune-endocrine cross-talk. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of 27 publicly available vertebrate and seven newly sequenced primate LGALS1 coding sequences reveal that intense purifying selection has been acting on residues in the carbohydrate recognition domain and dimerization interface that are involved in immune functions. Parsimony- and codon model-based phylogenetic analysis of coding sequences show that amino acid replacements occurred in early mammalian evolution on key residues, including gain of cysteines, which regulate immune functions by redox status-mediated conformational changes that disable sugar binding and dimerization, and that the acquired immunoregulatory functions of galectin-1 then became highly conserved in eutherian lineages, suggesting the emergence of hormonal and redox regulation of galectin-1 in placental mammals may be implicated in maternal-fetal immune tolerance.},

  ABSTRACT     = {BACKGROUND: Ly-6 superfamily members have a conserved Ly-6 domain that is defined by a distinct disulfide bonding pattern between eight or ten cysteine residues. These members are divided into membrane-type and secretory-type proteins. In the present study, we report the identification of a novel Ly-6 domain protein, secreted protein of Ly-6 domain 1 (SOLD1), from bovine placenta. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SOLD1 mRNA was expressed in trophoblast mononucleate cells and the protein was secreted into and localized in the extracellular matrix of the mesenchyme in cotyledonary villi. SOLD1 bound mainly with type I collagen telopeptide. We confirmed secretion of SOLD1 from the basolateral surface of a bovine trophoblast cell line (BT-1). It may be related to the organization of the extra-cellular matrix in the mesenchyme of fetal villi. Since trophoblast mononucleate cells are epithelial cells, their polar organization is expected to have a crucial role in the SOLD1 secretion system. We established that SOLD1 is an intronless bovine gene containing the Alu retrotransposon, which was integrated via cytoplasmic reverse transcription. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel retrotransposon-like Ly-6 domain protein in bovine placenta. SOLD1 is a crucial secreted protein that is involved in the organization of the mesenchyme of the cotyledonary villi. Furthermore, the gene encoding SOLD1 has an interesting genomic structure.},

  ABSTRACT     = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are the major class of gene-regulating molecules playing diverse roles through sequence complementarity to target mRNAs at post-transcriptional level. Tightly regulated expression and interaction of a multitude of genes for ovarian folliculogenesis could be regulated by these miRNAs. Identification of them is the first step towards understanding miRNA-guided gene regulation in different biological functions. Despite increasing efforts in miRNAs identification across various species and diverse tissue types, little is known about bovine ovarian miRNAs. Here, we report the identification and characterization of miRNAs expressed in the bovine ovary through cloning, expression analysis and target prediction. RESULTS: The miRNA library (5'-independent ligation cloning method), which was constructed from bovine ovary in this study, revealed cloning of 50 known and 24 novel miRNAs. Among all identified miRNAs, 38 were found to be new for bovine and were derived from 43 distinct loci showing characteristic secondary structure. While 22 miRNAs precursor loci were found to be well conserved in more than one species, 16 were found to be bovine specific. Most of the miRNAs were cloned multiple times, in which let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, miR-21, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-27a, miR-126 and miR-143 were cloned 10, 28, 13, 4, 11, 7, 6, 4 and 11 times, respectively. Expression analysis of all new and some annotated miRNAs in different intra-ovarian structures and in other multiple tissues showed that some were present ubiquitously while others were differentially expressed among different tissue types. Bta-miR-29a was localized in the follicular cells at different developmental stages in the cyclic ovary. Bio-informatics prediction, screening and Gene Ontology analysis of miRNAs targets identified several biological processes and pathways underlying the ovarian function. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest the presence of miRNAs in the bovine ovary, thereby elucidate their potential role in regulating diverse molecular and physiological pathways underlying the ovarian functionality. This information will give insights into bovine ovarian miRNAs, which can be further characterized for their role in follicular development and female fertility as well.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The rat mAb 33A10 recognizes an antigen in a variety of mouse epithelial tissues. In this study, we investigated in detail the expression pattern of the 33A10-defined antigen in the hair follicle. We show that 33A10 reactivity is confined to the most differentiated keratinocytes of the outer root sheath (ORS), the companion layer (CL), and to cells of the sebaceous gland duct. In vitro, the 33A10-defined antigen is expressed in keratinocytes derived from the ORS and accumulates on induction of differentiation. Using microarray analysis and transient transfection approaches, we established that the 33A10-defined antigen is the orphan protein, Placenta-expressed transcript (Plet)-1. Biochemical data indicated that Plet-1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein with N-linked carbohydrates in addition to other posttranslational modifications. Although silencing of Plet-1 expression using stable RNA interference in ORS keratinocytes decreased cellular migration, it increased adhesion to collagens I and IV. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Plet-1 was primarily localized at the leading edge of epidermal wounds, where keratinocytes contacted the eschar. The restricted localization in both differentiated ORS and CL cells contacting the hair fiber and epidermal wounds suggests a role for the Plet-1 protein in regulating the interaction of keratinocytes with inert tissues.},

@ARTICLE{Keniry.ea2012:H19lincRNAisdevelopmental,
  ABSTRACT     = {The H19 large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) is one of the most highly abundant and conserved transcripts in mammalian development, being expressed in both embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages, yet its physiological function is unknown. Here we show that miR-675, a microRNA (miRNA) embedded in H19's first exon, is expressed exclusively in the placenta from the gestational time point when placental growth normally ceases, and placentas that lack H19 continue to grow. Overexpression of miR-675 in a range of embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lines results in their reduced proliferation; targets of the miRNA are upregulated in the H19 null placenta, including the growth-promoting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) gene. Moreover, the excision of miR-675 from H19 is dynamically regulated by the stress-response RNA-binding protein HuR. These results suggest that H19's main physiological role is in limiting growth of the placenta before birth, by regulated processing of miR-675. The controlled release of miR-675 from H19 may also allow rapid inhibition of cell proliferation in response to cellular stress or oncogenic signals.},

@ARTICLE{Rutanen.ea1987:Progesterone-associatedproteinsPP12and,
  ABSTRACT     = {Two proteins, designated as PP12 and PP14 were originally isolated from soluble extracts of the human placenta and its adjacent membranes. We have shown that they are synthesized by decidualized/secretory endometrium and not by placenta. Both proteins occur at high concentrations in human amniotic fluid, which is therefore an excellent source for purification. PP12 is a 34-kDa glycoprotein, which has an N-terminal amino acid sequence of Ala-Pro-Trp-Gln-Cys-Ala-Pro-Cys-Ser-Ala. This is identical with that of somatomedin-binding protein purified from the amniotic fluid. PP12 too binds somatomedin-C, or IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor-I). Human secretory endometrium synthesizes and secretes PP12, and progesterone stimulates its secretion. PP14 is a 28-kDa glycoprotein. Its N-terminal sequence shows homology to that of beta-lactoglobulins from various species. We have found PP14 in the human endometrium, serum and milk. Immunologically, PP14 is related to progestagen-associated endometrial protein (PEP), alpha-2 pregnancy-associated endometrial protein (alpha-2, PEG), endometrial protein 15 (EP15), alpha-uterine protein (AUP) and chorionic alpha-2 microglobulin (CAG-2). In ovulatory menstrual cycles, the concentration of PP14 increases in endometrial tissue as the secretory changes advance. In serum, the PP14 concentration begins to rise later than the progesterone levels, and high serum PP14 levels are maintained for the first days of the next cycle. By contrast, no elevation of serum PP14 level is seen in anovulatory cycles. Our results show that progesterone-associated proteins are synthesized by the human endometrium and appear in the peripheral circulation, where they can be quantitatively measured using immunochemical techniques.},

@ARTICLE{Holland.ea1997:Characterizationofembryonicglobin,
  ABSTRACT     = {The embryonic hemoglobins of the marsupial Tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) are known to aggregate, which was shown by the finding that the Hill coefficient, h, was greater than 4.0 in the upper part of the oxygen equilibrium curve. Here, we have undertaken a detailed primary structure analysis of the Tammar wallaby pouch young hemoglobin complement, which we hoped might provide clues into the residues that cause aggregation and a high embryonic h. The Tammar wallaby embryonic hemoglobin complement is principally four major hemoglobins each with a different isoelectric point. Two early expressed hemoglobins contain the same embryonic beta-like chain, epsilon (epsilon), but two separate alpha-like chains, termed zeta and zeta prime (zeta and zeta') both of which are N-terminally blocked. The later two expressed hemoglobins contain the same adult alpha-chain, but different beta-like chains. The latest expressed hemoglobin contains the same beta-like chain, epsilon, as the two early expressed forms, but the third expressed hemoglobin contains a unique beta-like chain which we have termed omega (omega). A protein database similarity search using the first 54 N-terminal amino acids of the omega-chain showed a range of sequence identities of 57-72\% to all known mammalian beta-like chains, including the other marsupial epsilon-chains. The closest identity, reflected by both the highest percentage identity and Smith-Waterman score, was with the embryonic beta-chains of the aves. While the primary structures of the hemoglobins reported here do not explain the low hemoglobin-oxygen affinity in embryonic marsupial blood, the finding of the similarity with the bird globin-like sequence with one of the marsupial chains has implications on mammalian globin evolution. How many other marsupials and placental mammals are harboring a bird-like globin in their embryos?},

@ARTICLE{Opazo.ea2008:Genomicevidenceforindependent,
  ABSTRACT     = {Phylogenetic reconstructions of the beta-globin gene family in vertebrates have revealed that developmentally regulated systems of hemoglobin synthesis have been reinvented multiple times in independent lineages. For example, the functional differentiation of embryonic and adult beta-like globin genes occurred independently in birds and mammals. In both taxa, the embryonic beta-globin gene is exclusively expressed in primitive erythroid cells derived from the yolk sac. However, the "epsilon-globin" gene in birds is not orthologous to the epsilon-globin gene in mammals, because they are independently derived from lineage-specific duplications of a proto beta-globin gene. Here, we report evidence that the early and late expressed beta-like globin genes in monotremes and therian mammals (marsupials and placental mammals) are the products of independent duplications of a proto beta-globin gene in each of these two lineages. Results of our analysis of genomic sequence data from a large number of vertebrate taxa, including sequence from the recently completed platypus genome, reveal that the epsilon- and beta-globin genes of therian mammals arose via duplication of a proto beta-globin gene after the therian/monotreme split. Our analysis of genomic sequence from the platypus also revealed the presence of a duplicate pair of beta-like globin genes that originated via duplication of a proto beta-globin gene in the monotreme lineage. This discovery provides evidence that, in different lineages of mammals, descendent copies of the same proto beta-globin gene may have been independently neofunctionalized to perform physiological tasks associated with oxygen uptake and storage during embryonic development.},

Advances in our ability to measure RNA expression have resulted in a gradual increase in the number of identified housekeeping genes. Here, we describe housekeeping gene detection in the era of massive parallel sequencing and RNA-seq. We emphasize the importance of expression at a constant level and provide a list of 3804 human genes that are expressed uniformly across a panel of tissues. Several exceptionally uniform genes are singled out for future experimental use, such as RT-PCR control genes. Finally, we discuss both ways in which current technology can meet some of past obstacles encountered, and several as yet unmet challenges.},

In recent years, there has been much research into the endogenous mechanisms by which inflammatory reactions are terminated and tissue homoeostasis is restored, a process termed resolution. The identification and characterisation of naturally occurring pro-resolution mediators including lipoxins and annexin A1 has prompted a shift in the field of anti-inflammation whereby resolution is now observed as an active process, triggered as part of a normal inflammatory response. This review will address the process of resolution, discuss available evidence for expression of pro-resolution factors in the reproductive tract and explore possible roles for resolution in physiological reproductive processes and associated pathologies.},

METHOD OF STUDY: Placental expression of TIMP3 and TACE was examined by immunostaining and Western blot. Effects of TIMP3 on TACE expression and TNFα production were assessed by transfection of TIMP3 siRNA into trophoblasts isolated from normal placentas. Effects of oxidative stress on trophoblast TIMP3 expression and TNFα production were also determined. Trophoblast production of TIMP3, TACE and TNFα were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: TIMP3 expression was markedly reduced in preeclamptic placentas compared with normal placentas; oxidative stress down-regulated trophoblast TIMP3 expression and production, P < 0.01. Down-regulation of TIMP3 expression by TIMP3 siRNA resulted in significant increases in TACE expression and TNFα production, P < 0.01. CONCLUSION: As TIMP3 is an endogenous TACE inhibitor, down-regulation of trophoblast TIMP3 expression/activity could result in increased TACE expression and subsequently lead to increased TNFα production in preeclamptic placentas.},

@ARTICLE{Xiang.ea2013:PromoterhypomethylationofTIMP3,
  ABSTRACT     = {A study by Yuen RK, Penaherrera MS, von Dadelszen P, McFadden DE, Robinson WP. DNA methylation profiling of human placentas reveals promoter hypomethylation of multiple genes in early-onset preeclampsia. Eur J Hum Genet 2010;18:1006-1012 based on a Canadian population found the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) gene to be hypomethylated in pre-eclampsia (PE) placentas and to be a potential prenatal marker for early onset PE. To further explore the role of TIMP3 in PE and to investigate whether the TIMP3 promoter shows the same methylation pattern in the Han Chinese population, we analyzed a complete methylation assay of TIMP3 including the promoter region studied in the Canadian report and the neighboring CpG island in placentas (cases n = 41, controls n = 22) maternal peripheral blood (cases n = 3; controls n = 6) and umbilical cord blood (cases n = 7; controls n = 8) using MassArray EpiTyper (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Our results confirmed the finding of aberrant TIMP3 promoter methylation in PE placentas (mean = 0.405) compared with those in controls (mean = 0.534, P = 9.40 × 10(-7)). A tissue-specific methylation pattern between placentas (mean = 0.459) and bloods (mean = 0.961, P = 6.91 × 10(-13)) was also demonstrated in our clinical samples. Furthermore, a nearly 2-fold increase in TIMP3 expression for the hypomethylated promoter was found in PE placentas (P = 0.007), pointing to a negative relationship between TIMP3 methylation and the expression (R = -0.758, P = 0.029). In conclusion, we replicated the findings of Yuen et al. in our Han Chinese-based study, confirming that TIMP3 is likely to be involved in the etiology of PE and that hypomethylated and placenta-specific TIMP3 may be a potential marker for early diagnosis of PE in maternal plasma.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta(5)-Delta(4) isomerase (3beta-HSD) isoenzymes are responsible for the oxidation and isomerization of Delta(5)-3beta-hydroxysteroid precursors into Delta(4)-ketosteroids, thus catalyzing an essential step in the formation of all classes of active steroid hormones. In humans, expression of the type I isoenzyme accounts for the 3beta-HSD activity found in placenta and peripheral tissues, whereas the type II 3beta-HSD isoenzyme is predominantly expressed in the adrenal gland, ovary, and testis, and its deficiency is responsible for a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Phylogeny analyses of the 3beta-HSD gene family strongly suggest that the need for different 3beta-HSD genes occurred very late in mammals, with subsequent evolution in a similar manner in other lineages. Therefore, to a large extent, the 3beta-HSD gene family should have evolved to facilitate differential patterns of tissue- and cell-specific expression and regulation involving multiple signal transduction pathways, which are activated by several growth factors, steroids, and cytokines. Recent studies indicate that HSD3B2 gene regulation involves the orphan nuclear receptors steroidogenic factor-1 and dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome gene 1 (DAX-1). Other findings suggest a potential regulatory role for STAT5 and STAT6 in transcriptional activation of HSD3B2 promoter. It was shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) requires intact STAT5; on the other hand IL-4 induces HSD3B1 gene expression, along with IL-13, through STAT 6 activation. However, evidence suggests that multiple signal transduction pathways are involved in IL-4 mediated HSD3B1 gene expression. Indeed, a better understanding of the transcriptional factors responsible for the fine control of 3beta-HSD gene expression may provide insight into mechanisms involved in the functional cooperation between STATs and nuclear receptors as well as their potential interaction with other signaling transduction pathways such as GATA proteins. Finally, the elucidation of the molecular basis of 3beta-HSD deficiency has highlighted the fact that mutations in the HSD3B2 gene can result in a wide spectrum of molecular repercussions, which are associated with the different phenotypic manifestations of classical 3beta-HSD deficiency and also provide valuable information concerning the structure-function relationships of the 3beta-HSD superfamily. Furthermore, several recent studies using type I and type II purified enzymes have elegantly further characterized structure-function relationships responsible for kinetic differences and coenzyme specificity.},

In part, these processes have remained elusive because of divergence in reproductive strategies and physiology shown by model organisms, making extrapolation to humans uncertain. Here, we summarize the evolution of progesterone signaling and variation in pregnancy maintenance and termination. We use this comparative physiology to support the hypothesis that selective pressure on genomic loci involved in the timing of parturition have shaped human birth timing, and that these loci can be identified with comparative genomic strategies. Previous limitations imposed by divergence of mechanisms provide an important new opportunity to elucidate fundamental pathways of parturition control through increasing availability of sequenced genomes and associated reproductive physiology characteristics across diverse organisms.},

@ARTICLE{Wallis2009:ProlactininAfrotheriacharacterization,
  ABSTRACT     = {Pituitary prolactin shows an episodic pattern of molecular evolution, with occasional short bursts of rapid change imposed on a generally rather slow evolutionary rate. In mammals, episodes of rapid change occurred in the evolution of primates, cetartiodactyls, rodents and the elephant. The bursts of rapid evolution in cetartiodactyls and rodents were followed by duplications of the prolactin gene that gave rise to large families of prolactin-related proteins including placental lactogens, while in primates the burst was followed by corresponding duplications of the related GH gene. The position in elephant is less clear. Extensive data relating to the genomic sequences of elephant and two additional members of the group Afrotheria are now available, and have been used here to characterize the prolactin genes in these species and explore whether additional prolactin-related genes are present. The results confirm the rapid evolution of elephant (Loxodonta africana) prolactin - the sequence of elephant prolactin is substantially different from that predicted for the ancestral placental mammal. Hyrax (Procavia capensis) prolactin is even more divergent but tenrec (Echinops telfairi) prolactin is strongly conserved. No evidence was obtained from searches of public databases for additional genes encoding prolactin-like proteins in any of these species. Detailed analysis of evolutionary rates, and other factors, indicates that the episode of rapid change in hyrax, and probably elephant, was adaptive, though the nature of the associated biological change(s) is not clear.},

  ABSTRACT     = {BACKGROUND: The placenta is essential for supplying nutrients and gases to the developing mammalian young before birth. While all mammals have a functional placenta, only in therian mammals (marsupials and eutherians) does the placenta closely appose or invade the uterine endometrium. The eutherian placenta secretes hormones that are structurally and functionally similar to pituitary growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Marsupial and eutherian mammals diverged from a common ancestor approximately 125 to 148 million years ago and developed distinct reproductive strategies. As in eutherians, marsupials rely on a short-lived but functional placenta for embryogenesis. RESULTS: We characterized pituitary GH, GH-R, IGF-2, PRL and LHβ in a macropodid marsupial, the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii. These genes were expressed in the tammar placenta during the last third of gestation when most fetal growth occurs and active organogenesis is initiated. The mRNA of key growth genes GH, GH-R, IGF-2 and PRL were expressed during late pregnancy. We found significant up-regulation of GH, GH-R and IGF-2 after the start of the rapid growth phase of organogenesis which suggests that the placental growth hormones regulate the rapid phase of fetal growth. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of the existence of pituitary hormones in the marsupial placenta. Placental expression of these pituitary hormones has clearly been conserved in marsupials as in eutherian mammals, suggesting an ancestral origin of the evolution of placental expression and a critical function of these hormones in growth and development of all therian mammals.},

Systemic PRL is produced by the anterior pituitary, but extrapituitary PRL has also been detected in many tissues including the human endometrium. Prolactin is essential for pregnancy in rodents and one of the most dramatically induced genes in the endometrium during human pregnancy. The promoter for human endometrial Prl is located about 5.8 kb upstream of the pituitary promoter and is derived from a transposable element called MER39. Although it has been shown that prolactin is expressed in the pregnant endometrium of a few mammals other than humans, MER39 has been described as primate specific. Thus, in an effort to understand mechanisms of prolactin regulatory evolution, we sought to determine how uterine prolactin is transcribed in species that lack MER39. Using a variety of complementary strategies, including reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and whole-transcriptome sequencing, we show that endometrial Prl expression is not a shared character of all placental mammals, as it is not expressed in rabbits, pigs, dogs, or armadillos. We show that in primates, mice, and elephants, prolactin mRNA is transcribed in the pregnant endometrium from alternative promoters, different from the pituitary promoter and different from each other. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spider monkey promoter derives from the long terminal repeat (LTR) element MER39 as in humans, the mouse promoter derives from the LTR element MER77, and the elephant promoter derives from the lineage-specific LINE retrotransposon L1-2_LA. We also find surprising variation of transcriptional start sites within these transposable elements and of Prl splice variants, suggesting a high degree of flexibility in the promoter architecture even among closely related species. Finally, the three groups shown here to express endometrial prolactin-the higher primates, the rodents, and the elephant-represent three of the four lineages that showed adaptive evolution of the Prl gene in an earlier study (Wallis M. 2000. Episodic evolution of protein hormones: molecular evolution of pituitary prolactin. J Mol Evol. 50:465-473), which supports our findings and suggests that the selective forces responsible for accelerated Prl evolution were in the endometrium. This is the first reported case of convergent evolution of gene expression through the independent recruitment of different transposable elements, highlighting the importance of transposable elements in gene regulatory, and potentially adaptive, evolution.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Evolutionary change in gene regulation can result from changes in cis-regulatory elements, leading to differences in the temporal and spatial expression of genes or in the coding region of transcription factors leading to novel functions or both. Although there is a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of cis-regulatory evolution, examples of protein-mediated evolution of novel developmental pathways have not been demonstrated. Here, we investigate the evolution of prolactin (PRL) expression in endometrial cells, which is essential for placentation/pregnancy in eutherian mammals and is a direct regulatory target of the transcription factor HoxA-11. Here, we show that (i) endometrial PRL expression is a derived feature of placental mammals, (ii) the PRL regulatory gene HoxA-11 experienced a period of strong positive selection in the stem-lineage of eutherian mammals, and (iii) only HoxA-11 proteins from placental mammals, including the reconstructed ancestral eutherian gene, are able to up-regulate PRL from the promoter used in endometrial cells. In contrast, HoxA-11 from the reconstructed therian ancestor, opossum, platypus, and chicken are unable to up-regulate PRL expression. These results demonstrate that the evolution of novel gene expression domains is not only mediated by the evolution of cis-regulatory elements but can also require evolutionary changes of transcription factor proteins themselves.},

@ARTICLE{Papper.ea2009:Ancientoriginofplacental,
  ABSTRACT     = {In anthropoid primates, growth hormone (GH) genes have undergone at least 2 independent locus expansions, one in platyrrhines (New World monkeys) and another in catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes). In catarrhines, the GH cluster has a pituitary-expressed gene called GH1; the remaining GH genes include placental GHs and placental lactogens. Here, we provide cDNA sequence evidence that the platyrrhine GH cluster also includes at least 3 placenta expressed genes and phylogenetic evidence that placenta expressed anthropoid GH genes have undergone strong adaptive evolution, whereas pituitary-expressed GH genes have faced strict functional constraint. Our phylogenetic evidence also points to lineage-specific gene gain and loss in early placental mammalian evolution, with at least three copies of the GH gene present at the time of the last common ancestor (LCA) of primates, rodents, and laurasiatherians. Anthropoid primates and laurasiatherians share gene descendants of one of these three copies, whereas rodents and strepsirrhine primates each maintain a separate copy. Eight of the amino-acid replacements that occurred on the lineage leading to the LCA of extant anthropoids have been implicated in GH signaling at the maternal-fetal interface. Thus, placental expression of GH may have preceded the separate series of GH gene duplications that occurred in catarrhines and platyrrhines (i.e., the roles played by placenta-expressed GHs in human pregnancy may have a longer evolutionary history than previously appreciated).},

@ARTICLE{Männik.ea2010:Differentialexpressionprofileof,
  ABSTRACT     = {CONTEXT: The human growth hormone/chorionic somatomammotropin (hGH/CSH) locus at 17q22-24, consisting of one pituitary-expressed postnatal (GH1) and four placenta-expressed genes (GH2, CSH1, CSH2, and CSHL1), is implicated in regulation of postnatal and intrauterine growth. A positive correlation has been reported between the offspring's birth weight and serum placental GH (coded by GH2) and placental lactogen (coded by CSH1, CSH2) levels in pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was the investigation of the hypothesis that the mRNA expression profile of placental hGH/CSH genes contributes to the determination of birth weight. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We developed a sensitive, fluorescent-labeled semiquantitative RT-PCR assay coupled with gene-specific restriction analysis, capable of distinguishing alternative splice-products of individual placental hGH/CSH genes and quantification of their relative expression levels. The detailed profile of alternative transcripts of GH2, CSH1, CSH2, and CSHL1 genes in placenta from uncomplicated term pregnancies of the REPROMETA sample collection was addressed in association with the birth weight of newborns, grouped as appropriate for gestational age (AGA; n = 23), small for gestational age (SGA; n = 15), and large for gestational age (LGA; n = 34). RESULTS: The majority of pregnancies with SGA newborn showed down-regulation of the entire hGH/CSH cluster in placenta, whereas in the case of LGA, the expression of CSH1-1, CSH2-1, and CSHL1-4 mRNA transcripts in placenta was significantly increased compared with AGA newborns (P < 0.0001, P = 0.009, P = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: The expression profile of placental hGH/CSH genes in placenta is altered in pregnancies accompanied by SGA and LGA compared with AGA newborns, and thus, it may directly affect the circulating fetal and maternal placental GH and placental lactogen levels.},

@ARTICLE{Alsat.ea1998:Physiologicalroleofhuman,
  ABSTRACT     = {Placental growth hormone (PGH) is the product of the GH-V gene specifically expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer of the human placenta. PGH differs from pituitary growth hormone by 13 amino acids. It has high somatogenic and low lactogenic activities. Assays of PGH by specific monoclonal antibodies reveal that in the maternal circulation from 15-20 weeks up to term, PGH gradually replaces pituitary growth hormone which becomes undetectable. It is secreted by the placenta in a non-pulsatile manner. This continuous secretion appears to have important implications for physiological adjustment to gestation and especially in the control of maternal IGF1 levels. PGH secretion is inhibited by glucose in vitro and in vivo, and is significantly decreased in the maternal circulation in cases of pregnancies with intrauterine growth retardation. PGH does not appear to have a direct effect on fetal growth, as this hormone is not detectable in the fetal circulation. However the physiological role of PGH might also include a direct influence on placental development via an autocrine or paracrine mechanism as suggested by the presence of specific GH receptors in this tissue.},

@ARTICLE{Lacroix.ea2005:Stimulationofhumantrophoblast,
  ABSTRACT     = {A critical step in establishment of human pregnancy is the invasion of the uterus wall by the extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVCT), a process regulated by multiple autocrine and paracrine factors. Hormones belonging to the GH/prolactin family are expressed at the maternofetal interface. Because they are involved in cell motility in various models, we examined the possible regulatory role of human placental GH (hPGH) in EVCT invasiveness. By using an in vitro invasion model, we found that EVCT isolated from first-trimester chorionic villi and cultured on Matrigel secreted hPGH and expressed human GH receptor (hGHR). These data were confirmed by in situ immunohistochemistry. EVCT expressed the full-length and truncated forms of hGHR, and the Janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription factor-5 signaling pathway was activated in EVCT by hPGH treatment. Strong hPGH and hGHR expression was observed when EVCT invaded Matrigel and moved through the pores of the filter on which they were cultured. hPGH stimulated EVCT invasiveness, and this effect was inhibited by a Janus kinase-2 inhibitor. Interestingly, hPGH was more efficient than pituitary GH in stimulating EVCT invasiveness. These results offer the first evidence for a placental role of hPGH and suggest an autocrine/paracrine role of hPGH in the regulation of trophoblast invasion.},

  ABSTRACT     = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between arterial resistance and placental growth hormone (hGH-V) levels in the maternal circulation. STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-seven women with normal pregnancy, 13 with preeclampsia (PE) and 11 with intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR) underwent Doppler sonography of the placental and nonplacental uterine and cubital artery and blood sampling. hGH-V was measured with a highly sensitive sandwich-type immunofluorometric assay and pituitary growth hormone (hGH-N) and insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) with a chemiluminescence assay. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: During normal pregnancy the arterial pulsatility index (PI) decreased (p < 0.001), serum levels of hGH-V and IGF-I increased (p < 0.0001), and hGH-N decreased (p < 0.0001). Pathologic pregnancies (PE, IUGR) showed a significant higher PI in all arteries, but hGH-V and the IGF-I were decreased. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate a strong correlation between decreasing uterine and peripheral arterial resistance and increasing hGH-V during normal pregnancies with impaired uterine blood flow there were lowered serum levels of hGH-V, hGH-N and IGF-I. Lower levels of hGH-V and hGH-N might contribute to impaired uteroplacental circulation.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is a critical signal in establishing pregnancy in humans and some other primates, but this placentally expressed hormone has not been found in other mammalian orders. The gene for one of its two subunits (CG beta subunit [CGbeta]) arose by duplication from the luteinizing hormone beta subunit gene (LHbeta), present in all mammals tested. In this study, 14 primate and related mammalian species were examined by Southern blotting and DNA sequencing to determine where in mammalian phylogeny the CGbeta gene originated. Bats (order Chiroptera), flying lemur (order Dermoptera), strepsirrhine primates, and tarsiers do not have a CGbeta gene, although they possess one copy of the LHbeta gene. The CGbeta gene first arose in the common ancestor of the anthropoid primates (New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans), after the anthropoids diverged from tarsiers. At least two subsequent duplication events occurred in the catarrhine primates, all of which possess multiple CGbeta copies. The LHbeta-CGbeta family of genes has undergone frequent gene conversion among the catarrhines, as well as periods of strong positive selection in the New World monkeys (platyrrhines). In addition, newly generated DNA sequences from the promoter of the CG alpha subunit gene indicate that platyrrhine monkeys use a different mechanism of alpha gene expression control than that found in catarrhines.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The human genome evolution project seeks to reveal the genetic underpinnings of key phenotypic features that are distinctive of humans, such as a greatly enlarged cerebral cortex, slow development, and long life spans. This project has focused predominantly on genotypic changes during the 6-million-year descent from the last common ancestor (LCA) of humans and chimpanzees. Here, we argue that adaptive genotypic changes during earlier periods of evolutionary history also helped shape the distinctive human phenotype. Using comparative genome sequence data from 10 vertebrate species, we find a signature of human ancestry-specific adaptive evolution in 1,240 genes during their descent from the LCA with rodents. We also find that the signature of adaptive evolution is significantly different for highly expressed genes in human fetal and adult-stage tissues. Functional annotation clustering shows that on the ape stem lineage, an especially evident adaptively evolved biological pathway contains genes that function in mitochondria, are crucially involved in aerobic energy production, and are highly expressed in two energy-demanding tissues, heart and brain. Also, on this ape stem lineage, there was adaptive evolution among genes associated with human autoimmune and aging-related diseases. During more recent human descent, the adaptively evolving, highly expressed genes in fetal brain are involved in mediating neuronal connectivity. Comparing adaptively evolving genes from pre- and postnatal-stage tissues suggests that different selective pressures act on the development vs. the maintenance of the human phenotype.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Serum concentrations of relaxin and progesterone were measured by specific radioimmunoassays in pregnant, pseudopregnant, or ovariectomized (between gestation weeks 4 and 5) pregnant Labrador Retriever bitches. Daily administration of 17 alpha-ethyl-19-nortestosterone was performed to maintain gestation in the ovariectomized pregnant bitches. This synthetic gestagen was selected because it did not interfere with the assay for endogenously secreted progesterone concentration in serum. Serum progesterone concentration was high in ovarian-intact pregnant or pseudopregnant bitches, but the mean progesterone concentration in pseudopregnant bitches (evaluated at 4 weeks after mating) was only 56\% of the concentration in pregnant bitches. After ovariectomy, serum progesterone concentration decreased to undetectable values. Unlike progesterone, serum relaxin concentration increased during the latter half of pregnancy in the ovarian-intact and in the ovariectomized pregnant bitches, but relaxin was not detectable at any time in the pseudopregnant bitches. The amount of relaxin measured in the ovariectomized pregnant bitches was less (P less than 0.05) than that in ovarian-intact bitches, suggesting that the ovaries may have contributed to the total circulating relaxin concentration in the latter. Placental production of relaxin might have accounted for the serum relaxin concentration after ovariectomy; thus, the ovary and placenta each may secrete relaxin during gestation in bitches. Regardless of its source, measurement of serum relaxin concentration may offer a useful way of distinction between pregnancy and pseudopregnancy in dogs.},

  ABSTRACT     = {In situ hybridization employing a cRNA probe derived from a 428-bp fragment of equine relaxin was used to localize relaxin mRNA, and immunocytochemistry was used to localize relaxin itself, in tissues of the placenta-endometrium interface recovered between 33 and 153 days of gestation from mares carrying intraspecific horse, interspecific mule and extraspecific donkey conceptuses. Immunocytochemical staining was also used to localize trophoblast-specific and class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on some specimens. Relaxin mRNA and relaxin were both present in the single-cell non-invasive trophoblast layer of the allantochorion between 45 and 153 days of gestation in all three types of equine pregnancy examined. Both, however, were absent from the invasive trophoblast cells of the progenitor chorionic girdle and the differentiated trophoblast cells of the endometrial cups throughout the latters' 60-80-day period of development and regression. Discrete and irregularly spaced clusters of elongated pseudostratified trophoblast cells on the allantochorion remained negative for relaxin mRNA and ligand, but stained strongly for equine trophoblast-specific antigens. These areolae-like structures of the mature horse placenta overlie the mouths of endometrial glands between adjacent microcotyledons and they are clearly involved with the uptake of uterine milk for fetal sustenance. It is speculated that their loose attachment to the endometrium and weak expression of class 1 MHC antigens may serve to tolerize the mother to the paternally-inherited histocompatibility antigens of the fetus.},

@ARTICLE{Meyer.ea2004:Speciesandfetalgender,
  ABSTRACT     = {Quantitative and temporal progestin profiles vary during gestation in the elephant, sometimes making it difficult to determine if a pregnancy is progressing normally. The aim of the present study was to determine if circulating progestin variability was related to species or fetal gender effects. A similar comparison also was conducted for secretory profiles of prolactin, relaxin, and cortisol. Overall mean progestin concentrations during gestation in Asian (n = 19) and African (n = 8) elephants were similar; however, the temporal profiles differed (P < 0.001). Concentrations were higher in African elephants during the first half of pregnancy, but then declined to levels below those observed in Asian elephants (P < 0.05). There also was a fetal gender effect in Asian, but not African elephants. Progestin concentrations were higher in Asian cows carrying male calves (n = 9) as compared to those carrying females (n = 10) (P < 0.001). Overall prolactin concentrations were higher in Asian than in African elephants between 8 and 15 months of gestation ( P< 0.001). There were no species differences in the secretory patterns of relaxin. Cortisol was relatively stable until the end of gestation when significant surges were observed, mainly between 8 and 11 days before parturition, and again on the day of birth. In sum, a comparison of progestin patterns between Asian and African elephants identified notable differences related to species and fetal gender. A role for cortisol in the initiation of parturition also was inferred from these data. From a practical standpoint, understanding the factors affecting gestational hormone characteristics and recognizing what the species differences are will help ensure that data used in diagnosing and monitoring elephant pregnancies are properly interpreted.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Immunoreactive relaxin activity and progesterone concentrations in weekly plasma samples were measured throughout six pregnancies in five Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). One animal aborted, one delivered a stillborn calf at term and the remaining pregnancies concluded normally with living young. Immunoreactive relaxin activity increased by week 20 of pregnancy to reach a mean peak concentrations of > 6 ng/ml in the second trimester. This was followed by a slow decline beginning approximately at 30 weeks before term. A smaller, secondary relaxin rise was observed during the final eight weeks preceding parturition and circulating concentrations remained above pre-pregnancy baseline values for 72 h after birth. In contrast, progesterone concentrations increased immediately after mating and rose to a maximum of > 2 ng/ml by mid-gestation. As with relaxin, progesterone concentrations began to decline gradually approximately 30 weeks before birth. More frequently collected samples before, during and after parturition revealed a decline to pre-pregnancy levels between 2-5 days before parturition, in contrast to elevated relaxin levels (1 ng/ml) during this time. The aborted pregnancy at week 35 was accompanied by a precipitous decline in both immunoreactive relaxin and progesterone concentrations one week before the visible termination of the pregnancy. The delivery of the term stillborn calf occurred five weeks after both immunoreactive relaxin and progesterone concentrations had declined to pre-pregnancy values. Results suggest that immunoreactive relaxin may be important, along with progesterone, in the maintenance of pregnancy in the Asian elephant as well as playing a role in preparation for birth and possibly to indicate foetal well-being.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone that has a variety of physiological effects both on remodelling of collagen and on uterine contractility. These are most apparent during pregnancy. The sequences of relaxin cDNAs derived from ovaries of late-pregnant random-bred Swiss mice have been established. Multiple subclones obtained from three independent polymerase chain reaction experiments were found to encode relaxins which were identical except at position 11 in the A chain (Ile or Val). All mouse relaxin cDNAs expressed in the ovary during pregnancy had an extra tyrosine inserted prior to the final A chain cysteine residue, a result confirmed by direct sequencing of relaxin peptides. Whilst this tyrosine insertion must have local effects on the folding of the A chain, structure-activity studies will clarify whether it perturbs functional interaction with the relaxin receptor. We have shown that there is a single relaxin gene in the mouse genome, and that expression during pregnancy occurs in the ovary but is not detectable in the placenta, uterus or fetus.},

@ARTICLE{Cameron.ea1996:sitesofgeneexpression,
  ABSTRACT     = {Atrial (ANP), brain (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) belong to a family of hormones important in blood pressure and sodium homeostasis. Expression of ANP has been reported in embryo hearts, but BNP and CNP expression during development has not been described. We used in situ hybridization to identify the sites of gene expression of ANP, BNP, and CNP during development in mouse embryos at daily intervals from midgestation. Very intense expression of ANP and BNP was visible in the heart from 9.5 days gestation; levels of expression of both peptides in the ventricle exceeded those in atria throughout gestation. There was a major peak of atrial and ventricular ANP and BNP expression at 12.5 days, attaining levels similar to those in adult heart and then declining until birth. Cardiac expression of CNP was undetectable. Expression of ANP and CNP was also observed in distinct sites in the brain, and all three peptides were expressed in the spinal cord. In mouse placenta, strong CNP expression was seen in the decidua basalis around the large maternal blood vessels, and BNP message was detected at the peripheral margin of the decidual layer. This pattern of expression indicates that ANP and CNP are present during development of the mouse central nervous system and suggests that CNP and BNP participate in regulating the maternal blood supply to the developing embryo.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Galectins are multifunctional regulators of fundamental cellular processes. They are also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, and play a functional role in immune-endocrine crosstalk. Some galectins have attracted attention in the reproductive sciences because they are highly expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, their functional significance in eutherian pregnancies has been documented, and their dysregulated expression is observed in the 'great obstetrical syndromes'. The evolution of these galectins has been linked to the emergence of eutherian mammals. Based on published evidence, galectins expressed at the maternal-fetal interface may serve as important proteins involved in maternal-fetal interactions, and the study of these galectins may facilitate the prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnancy complications.},

@ARTICLE{Than.ea2009:primatesubfamilyofgalectins,
  ABSTRACT     = {Galectins are proteins that regulate immune responses through the recognition of cell-surface glycans. We present evidence that 16 human galectin genes are expressed at the maternal-fetal interface and demonstrate that a cluster of 5 galectin genes on human chromosome 19 emerged during primate evolution as a result of duplication and rearrangement of genes and pseudogenes via a birth and death process primarily mediated by transposable long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). Genes in the cluster are found only in anthropoids, a group of primate species that differ from their strepsirrhine counterparts by having relatively large brains and long gestations. Three of the human cluster genes (LGALS13, -14, and -16) were found to be placenta-specific. Homology modeling revealed conserved three-dimensional structures of galectins in the human cluster; however, analyses of 24 newly derived and 69 publicly available sequences in 10 anthropoid species indicate functional diversification by evidence of positive selection and amino acid replacements in carbohydrate-recognition domains. Moreover, we demonstrate altered sugar-binding capacities of 6 recombinant galectins in the cluster. We show that human placenta-specific galectins are predominantly expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast, a primary site of metabolic exchange where, early during pregnancy, the fetus comes in contact with immune cells circulating in maternal blood. Because ex vivo functional assays demonstrate that placenta-specific galectins induce the apoptosis of T lymphocytes, we propose that these galectins reduce the danger of maternal immune attacks on the fetal semiallograft, presumably conferring additional immune tolerance mechanisms and in turn sustaining hemochorial placentation during the long gestation of anthropoid primates.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Genomic imprinting is widespread in eutherian mammals. Marsupial mammals also have genomic imprinting, but in fewer loci. It has long been thought that genomic imprinting is somehow related to placentation and/or viviparity in mammals, although neither is restricted to mammals. Most imprinted genes are expressed in the placenta. There is no evidence for genomic imprinting in the egg-laying monotreme mammals, despite their short-lived placenta that transfers nutrients from mother to embryo. Post natal genomic imprinting also occurs, especially in the brain. However, little attention has been paid to the primary source of nutrition in the neonate in all mammals, the mammary gland. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) play an important role as imprinting control centres in each imprinted region which usually comprises both paternally and maternally expressed genes (PEGs and MEGs). The DMR is established in the male or female germline (the gDMR). Comprehensive comparative genome studies demonstrated that two imprinted regions, PEG10 and IGF2-H19, are conserved in both marsupials and eutherians and that PEG10 and H19 DMRs emerged in the therian ancestor at least 160 Ma, indicating the ancestral origin of genomic imprinting during therian mammal evolution. Importantly, these regions are known to be deeply involved in placental and embryonic growth. It appears that most maternal gDMRs are always associated with imprinting in eutherian mammals, but emerged at differing times during mammalian evolution. Thus, genomic imprinting could evolve from a defence mechanism against transposable elements that depended on DNA methylation established in germ cells.},

@ARTICLE{Harder.ea1993:Gestationandplacentationin,
  ABSTRACT     = {Estrus, gestation, and placentation were studied in the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and the gray short-tailed oppossum (Monodelphis domestica), representatives of the prototypic, New World marsupial family Didelphidae. Didelphis is a large (3,000 g), pouched opossum that exhibits a 28-day estrous cycle, spontaneous estrus and ovulation, and a high ovulation rate (60 ova per cycle). Monodelphis is a small (100 g), pouchless opossum with male-induced estrus and ovulation and a moderate ovulation rate (12 ova per cycle). Implantation occurs on day 10 of the 13-day gestation period in Didelphis and on day 12 of the 15-day gestation in Monodelphis. Gestation and placentation, including the ultrastructural features of trophoblastic apposition to the uterine mucosa, are very similar in Didelphis and Monodelphis. Differences, such as a larger increase in uterine volume and a more highly folded endometrium following implantation in Monodelphis are minor. They appear to be related to the smaller maternal body size and the relatively larger uterine load of embryos in Monodelphis. Because body size is one of the major variables among New World marsupials, the descriptions of gestation and placentation presented here for Didelphis and Monodelphis, provide a basis for comparison in future studies of didelphid marsupials.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The biochemical composition of uterine and fetal fluids during pregnancy of the grey short-tailed opossum was compared with new and published data on the tammar wallaby. In the grey short-tailed opossum, there are three main phases of embryonic nourishment. During the first phase, the embryo obtains nutrients from uterine secretion transferred into the yolk sac. The amount of uterine secretion declines during the second phase up to the time of shell coat rupture. As a result, the protein concentration in yolk sac fluid also declines. During phase three, which begins with shell coat rupture, nutrients are predominantly available from the maternal blood. In the grey short-tailed opossum that lacks a vesicular, fluid-filled allantois, waste products such as urea are apparently stored in the yolk sac and from there pass into the maternal circulation across the invasive yolk sac placenta. In contrast, in the tammar wallaby, the main source of nutrients available to the late term fetus is glandular secretion that is complemented by substances from the maternal circulation via the chorio-vitelline placenta, and waste products are stored in the large, fluid-filled allantois.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Whey acidic protein (WAP), a major whey protein present in milk of a number of mammalian species has characteristic cysteine-rich domains known as four-disulfide cores (4-DSC). Eutherian WAP, expressed in the mammary gland throughout lactation, has two 4-DSC domains, (DI-DII) whereas marsupial WAP, expressed only during mid-late lactation, contains an additional 4-DSC (DIII), and has a DIII-D1-DII configuration. We report the expression and evolution of echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and platypus (Onithorhynchus anatinus) WAP cDNAs. Predicted translation of monotreme cDNAs showed echidna WAP contains two 4-DSC domains corresponding to DIII-DII, whereas platypus WAP contains an additional domain at the C-terminus with homology to DII and has the configuration DIII-DII-DII. Both monotreme WAPs represent new WAP protein configurations. We propose models for evolution of the WAP gene in the mammalian lineage either through exon loss from an ancient ancestor or by rapid evolution via the process of exon shuffling. This evolutionary outcome may reflect differences in lactation strategy between marsupials, monotremes, and eutherians, and give insight to biological function of the gene products. WAP four-disulfide core domain 2 (WFDC2) proteins were also identified in echidna, platypus and tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) lactating mammary cells. WFDC2 proteins are secreted proteins not previously associated with lactation. Mammary gland expression of tammar WFDC2 during the course of lactation showed WFDC2 was elevated during pregnancy, reduced in early lactation and absent in mid-late lactation.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Positive selection (PS) in the thymus involves the presentation of self-peptides that are bound to MHC class II on the surface of cortical thymus epithelial cells (cTECs). Prss16 gene corresponds to one important element regulating the PS of CD4(+) T lymphocytes, which encodes Thymus-specific serine protease (Tssp), a cTEC serine-type peptidase involved in the proteolytic generation of self-peptides. Nevertheless, additional peptidase genes participating in the generation of self-peptides need to be found. Because of its role in the mechanism of PS and its expression in cTECs, the Prss16 gene might be used as a transcriptional marker to identify new genes that share the same expression profile and that encode peptidases in the thymus. To test this hypothesis, we compared the differential thymic expression of 4,500 mRNAs of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with their respective Prss16-knockout (KO) mutants by using microarrays. From these, 223 genes were differentially expressed, of which 115 had known molecular/biological functions. Four endopeptidase genes (Casp1, Casp2, Psmb3 and Tpp2) share the same expression profile as the Prss16 gene; i.e., induced in WT and repressed in KO while one endopeptidase gene, Capns1, features opposite expression profile. The Tpp2 gene is highlighted because it encodes a serine-type endopeptidase functionally similar to the Tssp enzyme. Profiling of the KO mice featured down-regulation of Prss16, as expected, along with the genes mentioned above. Considering that the Prss16-KO mice featured impaired PS, the shared regulation of the four endopeptidase genes suggested their participation in the mechanism of self-peptide generation and PS.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The Ly-6 protein family refers to a group of glycophosphatidyl inositol-anchored membrane proteins with ten conserved cysteines. They are thought to be involved in cellular adhesion and signaling. Recently, a subfamily of secreted Ly-6 proteins has been identified. In the present study, we report a secreted Ly-6 protein, secreted seminal vesicle Ly-6 protein 1 (SSLP-1) purified from mouse seminal vesicles using a series of steps including ion-exchange chromatography on a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sephacel column, gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column, and ion-exchange HPLC on a sulfopropyl column. Further analysis demonstrated it to be a novel, previously unnamed, 17 kDa glycoprotein. N-glycosidase F treatment revealed a core protein with a molecular mass of 8720 Da. By Basic Local Alignment Search Tool Protein analysis, we found that SSLP-1 had ten conserved cysteine residues identical with other secreted Ly-6 proteins. The gene Gm191, which is located on chromosome 9, encodes SSLP-1. By Northern blotting with 21 different mouse tissues, we found that Sslp-1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the seminal vesicle. Immunohistochemistry revealed SSLP-1 protein in the luminal fluid and mucosal epithelium of the seminal vesicles. The amount of Sslp-1 mRNA and SSLP-1 protein in the seminal vesicle was regulated by testosterone and correlated with the stage of animal maturation. The tissue-specific expression pattern suggests that SSLP-1 may play a physiological role in male mouse reproduction.},

@ARTICLE{Aarli.ea1997:Suppressiveeffectonlymphoproliferation,
  ABSTRACT     = {PROBLEM: Syncytiotrophoblast microvillous plasma membranes (StMPM) are potent suppressors of lymphoproliferation in vitro. We have previously shown that soluble annexin II (AII) is present at higher levels in retroplacental serum (RPS) than in peripheral serum, and that soluble AII has an immunosuppressive effect. The aims of this study were to determine whether AII can be released from StMPM and whether soluble AII from StMPM exerts any immunosuppressive effect. METHOD OF STUDY: Isolated StMPM were incubated in growth medium for 18 hr and supernatants were prepared by ultracentrifugation. Soluble AII was detected by immunoblotting. StMPM, StMPM supernatant, and affinity-purified AII were analysed in a lymphoproliferation assay for immunomodulating activity. RESULTS: AII heavy chain and its p11 light chain were detected both in StMPM supernatant and in RPS after removal of StMPM particles by ultracentrifugation. StMPM, StMPM supernatant, and purified AII suppressed lymphoproliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Absorption of AII from StMPM supernatant reduced the suppressive activity. The suppressive effect of StMPM supernatant and purified AII was completely reversed by heating at 100 degrees C for 30 min or by adding recombinant interleukin-2 at 100 units/ml. Although StMPM and affinity-purified AII suppressed the proliferation of lymphocytes from all donors tested, StMPM supernatant suppressed the proliferation of lymphocytes from 12 of 23 donors. Six of eight female non-suppressed donors were multiparae, whereas five of five female suppressed donors were nulliparae. CONCLUSIONS: Annexin II is released by isolated placental membranes in vitro and is present in RPS, indicating in vivo release of AII at the fetomaternal interface, probably as AII heterotetramer. AII has immunosuppressive activity and may be important in fetal allograft survival.},

@ARTICLE{Robillard.ea2002:Evolutionaryadaptationstopre-eclampsiaeclampsia,
  ABSTRACT     = {Gestational-hypertension/pre-eclampsia occurs in approximately 10\% of human pregnancies. This persistent complication of pregnancy has been reported to occur more frequently in couples conceiving very shortly after the beginning of their sexual relationship and/or after a change in paternity. Primipaternity may be the leading cause of pre-eclampsia in women under 30 years of age when genetic susceptibility to cardio-vascular disease has not yet been expressed, especially in women before their twenties, who for the last 40,000 years have perhaps comprised the age group when the majority of parturients classified as Homo sapiens sapiens initiated their reproductive life. In terms of evolution, the prevalence of pre-eclampsia represents a distinct reproductive disadvantage in humans as compared with other mammals. Indeed, pre-eclampsia is a consequence of the defect of the normal human-specific deep endovascular invasion of the trophoblast. The large size of the human fetal brain imposing this deep trophoblastic invasion induced the need for major immunogenetic compromises in terms of paternal-maternal tissue tolerance. The price that mankind has had to pay to adapt to the pre-eclampsia risk is a low fecundability rate and therefore loss of oestrus, possibly a step in the deviation between apes and hominids. Further, pre-eclampsia risk may be a contributing factor leading to the rejection of systematic polyandry in human societies and have influenced prohibition of incest.},

@ARTICLE{Boddy.ea2012:Comparativeanalysisofencephalization,
  ABSTRACT     = {There is a well-established allometric relationship between brain and body mass in mammals. Deviation of relatively increased brain size from this pattern appears to coincide with enhanced cognitive abilities. To examine whether there is a phylogenetic structure to such episodes of changes in encephalization across mammals, we used phylogenetic techniques to analyse brain mass, body mass and encephalization quotient (EQ) among 630 extant mammalian species. Among all mammals, anthropoid primates and odontocete cetaceans have significantly greater variance in EQ, suggesting that evolutionary constraints that result in a strict correlation between brain and body mass have independently become relaxed. Moreover, ancestral state reconstructions of absolute brain mass, body mass and EQ revealed patterns of increase and decrease in EQ within anthropoid primates and cetaceans. We propose both neutral drift and selective factors may have played a role in the evolution of brain-body allometry.},

@ARTICLE{Cunningham.ea2015:Ensembl2015,
  ABSTRACT     = {Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org) is a genomic interpretation system providing the most up-to-date annotations, querying tools and access methods for chordates and key model organisms. This year we released updated annotation (gene models, comparative genomics, regulatory regions and variation) on the new human assembly, GRCh38, although we continue to support researchers using the GRCh37.p13 assembly through a dedicated site (http://grch37.ensembl.org). Our Regulatory Build has been revamped to identify regulatory regions of interest and to efficiently highlight their activity across disparate epigenetic data sets. A number of new interfaces allow users to perform large-scale comparisons of their data against our annotations. The REST server (http://rest.ensembl.org), which allows programs written in any language to query our databases, has moved to a full service alongside our upgraded website tools. Our online Variant Effect Predictor tool has been updated to process more variants and calculate summary statistics. Lastly, the WiggleTools package enables users to summarize large collections of data sets and view them as single tracks in Ensembl. The Ensembl code base itself is more accessible: it is now hosted on our GitHub organization page (https://github.com/Ensembl) under an Apache 2.0 open source license.},

@ARTICLE{Ernest2003:lifehistorycharacteristicsofplacental,
  ABSTRACT     = {The purpose of this data set was to compile general life history characteristics for a variety of mammalian species in order to perform comparative life history analyses among different taxa and different body size groups. Data were collected from the literature, and data sources are documented for each species within the data file. Since life history characteristics will show minor variation with environmental conditions (resource availability, climate, competitive environment, and predation pressure) a general life history for each species was sought to average over minor differences in local populations. To create a general life history for each species, life history values are often an average from several literature sources. Life history variables included in the data set are: maximum lifespan (months), age of first reproduction (months), gestation time (months), weaning age (months), weaning mass (grams), litter size, litters per year, newborn mass (grams), and adult body mass (grams). Since these data were collected with the intent to examine general life history patterns, they are good for examining large-scale patterns, specifically in comparing life history characteristics for different orders or families of mammals. All orders of placental mammals, except Chiroptera (bats) are represented in this data set: Artiodactyla (161 species), Carnivora (197 species), Cetacea (55 species), Dermoptera (2 species), Hydracoidea (4 species), Insectivora (91 species), Lagomorpha (42 species), Macroscelidea (10 species), Perissodactyla (15 species), Pholidota (7 species), Primates (156 species), Proboscidea (2 species), Rodentia (665 species), Scandentia (7 species), Sirenia (5 species), Tubulidentata (1 species), and Xenarthra (20 species). There are two caveats on this data set, however. First, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of life history parameters with specific environmental conditions is important. Second, while this data set is extensive, it is not exhaustive. The creation of an exhaustive data set is the ultimate goal, but that goal is still several years from completion. In the meantime, researchers utilizing the data set are urged to conduct their own search for data not reported within the current data set. Researchers are also encouraged to contact the author of the data set and alert her to literature sources containing data for missing variables or species.},

@ARTICLE{Kiltie1982:intraspecificvariationmammaliangestation,
  ABSTRACT     = {Many summaries of the relationships between mean gestation period and other physiological and life history traits of terrestrial eutherian mammals have been published (Huggett and Widdas, 1951; Kihlstrim, 1972; Sacher and Staffeldt, 1974; Frazer and Huggett, 1974; Blueweiss et al., 1978; Case, 1978; Western, 1979; Tuomi, 1980; Zeveloff and Boyce, 1980; McNab, 1980; Lindstedt and Calder, 1981; Eisenberg, 1981; Millar, 1981), but data on intraspecific variation in gestation time have not been summarized and compared. Here I present a preliminary study of determinants of intraspecific variation in gestation time. The results may be of practical value in captive breeding programs and field studies of reproduction, and may provide insight into the relationships among breeding seasonality, gestation period, and the geographic distribution of mammalian species},
